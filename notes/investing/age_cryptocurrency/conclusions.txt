CONCLUSIONS
The Age of Cryptocurrency
Paul Vigna

Were bitcoin to actually become a dominant monetary power, it could create economic forces that would shock most global citizens. With the creation of new bitcoins capped at 21 million, bitcoin is a DEFLATIONARY currency. 

Our global economy as currently constructed is predicated on inflationary currencies. For a global economy that runs on credit and is no longer accustomed to the rigor of monetary control, a system based on bitcoinc could do great harm if it's not properly introduced. 

- In times of financial panic and economic disruption, people would hoard the limited-supply and highly-sought after digital currency.
- This would restrict the flow of money to everyone else and exacerbate the crisis. 
- Without a central bank acting as a lender of last resort, we would all starve for currency. It would be a repeat of the Great Depression.

Cyptocurrencies promise to dispel much of the enormous cost that a bank-centric model of payments imposes on our global economy. They could bring billions of people excluded from that sytem into the global economy, and through multiple blockchain based apllictactions, they promise to hold whole classes of middlemen, centralized institutions, and government agencies accountable as never before. 

Cryptocurrencies can claim to be the latest in a long line of technological developments that have shifted power out of the hands of centralized elites and handed it over to the people: the printing press, telegraph, telephone, television, internet. They have the potential to disrupt our societial structure and the great innovation that they present will change everything. We just can't predict how that will happen and how quickly it will be.
