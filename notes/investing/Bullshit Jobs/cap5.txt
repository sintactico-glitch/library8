CHAPTER 5: WHY ARE BULLSHIT JOBS PROLIFERATING?
Bullshit Jobs: A Theory
David Graeber

Economies around the world have, increasingly, become vast engines for producing nonsense. One reason why this has been so little acknowledged is that under our current economic system, this is not supposed to happen. All of this was supposed to have ended with the collapse of the Soviet bloc and the market reforms in the 90s.
People simply refused to believe capitalism could produce such results, even if that meeant invalidating their own experiences

Since 1980 we've seen a steady decline in farming and manufacturing, and a steady increase of the "service enconomy". The bulk of the service sector is FIRE (finance, insurance, real estate), which could be named as "information work"
The workforce of the service sector is quite small and it remained steady over time. What grew was the FIRE sector (information work), where most bullshit jobs proliferate.
(Add graphic of service sectors)
A majority of those classed as information workers feel that if their jobs were to vanish, it would make very little difference to the world.

One could argue that the whole FIRE sector is a scam, since the bulk of its profits come from  debt, speculation and the creation of complex financial instruments

1. On the individual level, why do people agree to do and put up with their own bullshit jobs?
2. On social and economic levels, what are the larger forces that have led to the proliferation of bullshit jobs?
3. On the cultural and political levels, why is the bullshitization of the economy not seen as a social problem, and why has no one done anything about it?

Looking at the subjective motives of those who take such jobs is then treated as an alternative to asking why so many people find themselves in a position where the only way they can get money is by taking such jobs to begin with.

    There has come to a tacit understanding that you can abscribe motives to people only when speaking about the individual level. Therefore, any suggestion that powerful people ever do anything they don't say they're doing is immediately denounced as a "paranoid conspiracy theory" to be rejected instantly.

SOCIAL ENGINEERING DOES HAPPEN. The regime of make-work jobs that existed in the Soviet Union or Communist China was created from above by a self-conscious government policy of full employment.
But it's not like a higher up send a directive saying "I order all officials to invent unnecessary jobs until unemployment is eliminated". It was not necessary to do so, the ideal of full employment that all economic policies strive for since World War II make it clear.
CALLING FOR JOBS NEVER SPECIFIES THAT THOSE JOBS SHOULD SERVE SOME USEFUL PURPOSE

One motive for mantaining the existent market-based system of health insurance, for example, is precisely its inefficiency. It's better to maintain those millions of basically useless office jobs than to find something else for the paper pushers to do.

There are two main objections to the proliferation of bullshit jobs:
- A group argues that bullshit jobs don't exist. Since competing firms would never pay workers to do nothing, their jobs must be useful in some way that they simply don't understand. Globalization has rendered the process of production so complicated that we need more and more office workers to adminiter it, so their jobs are not bullshit
- Another group admits that useless paper-pushing jobs exist and have increased, but they state that the amount of bullshit jobs that exist in the private sector must necessarily be a product of government interference. This must be true because the market is freedom, and freedom is always good

FIRE sector
When a profit-seeking enterprise is in the business of distributing a very large sum of money, the most profitable thing for it to do is to be as inefficient as possible.
This is basically what the FIRE sector does: it creates money (by making loans) and then moves it around in often extemely complicated ways, extracting a small cut with every transaction.
There's a very high level of stress, fear and paranoia in FIRE sector employees, especially banks. Employees are under enormous pressure not to ask too many questions and, in general, have little to no idea how their work contributes to the bank as a whole.
In the lower echelons, competence and efficiency actually do seem to be reigning values; the higher one goes up the ladder, the less true this appears to be.

    It's a system designed not to be understood, administrated by managers who have no idea what's going on below them, largely because it makes no sense. It's all just a meaningless ritual.
    If one reduced life to pure physicality, the fact that some abstractions are more "real" than others, if some jobs have legal, moral or economic purpose and others don't, it's not really that important. 
    It's as if they first forbid you to acknowledge your are engaging in empty ritual, then force you to attend seminars with hired gurus that tell you "In the end, isn't everything we do just empty ritual?"
