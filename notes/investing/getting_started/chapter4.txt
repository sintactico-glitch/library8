- CHAPTER 4: TRADING RANGES, SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE

A trading range is a horizontal corridor that contains price fluctuations for an extend period. 

- Markets tend to spend most of their time in trading ranges 
- Trading ranges are very difficult to trade profitably
- Most chart patterns (gaps, flags, etc) are relatively meaningless if they occur within a trading range
- Trading ranges can often last for years

Once a trading range is established, the upper and lower boundaries tend to define support and resistance areas. Breakouts from trading ranges can provide important trading signals.

TRADING RANGE BREAKOUTS 

A breakout from a trading range suggests an impending price move in the direction of the breakout

- The longer a trading range lasts, the more potentially significant the eventual breakout
- Breakouts from narrow ranges tend to provide more reliable trade signals
- Confirmation of Breakout. It's very common for prices to break out of a trading range by a small amount and for a few days, and then fall back into the range. The breakout will fail unless there are solid fundamental reasons for continued buying (look at the volume)
- The reliability of a brekout is significantly improved if prices are still beyond the range after a number of days (for example, 5 days)

Traders should experiment with different confirmation conditions rather than blindly following all breakouts.

SUPPORT AND RESISTANCE

Once a trading range is established (1 or 2 months of sideways price movement), prices will tend to meet resistance at the upper end of the range and support at the lower end of the range.
After prices breakout from the range, the roles of support and resistance flip. The upper end that used to be resistance is now support. 

Normally, resistance will be encountered near previous major highs, and support near major lows. 

    Support and resistance should be considered approximate areas, not precise points. 

Similar to the case of breakouts, penetration of highs and lows should be significant in terms of price magnitude, time duration, or both, to be viewed as trading signals.

- There is often a tendency for relative highs and relative lows to be concentrated in relative narrow zones. These zones imply support if current prices are higher and resistance if current prices are lower. 
- This approach is very useful for anticipating support and resistance areas in long-term charts.
