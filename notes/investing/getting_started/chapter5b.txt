- CHAPTER 5: CHART PATTERNS 
CONTINUATION PATTERNS

Continuation patterns are various types of congestion phases that happen in long-term trends. A continuation pattern is expected to be resolved by a price swing in the same direction that preceded its formation.

TRIANGLES

A symmetrical triangle is usually followed by a continuation of the trend that preceded it. Nonsymmetrical triangles will resolve to a trend in direction of the slope of the hypotenuse.

The direction of the breakout from a triangle formation is more important than the type.

FLAGS AND PENNANTS

Flags and pennants are narrow-band, short-duration (1 to 3 weeks) congestion phases within trends. It's called a flag when it's enclosed by parallel lines and a pennant when the lines converge. 
Flags and pennants typically represent pauses in a major trend. Usually, they're followed by price swings in the same direction as the price swings that preceded their formation.

A breakout from a flag or pennant can be viewed as a confirmation that the trend is continuing and a trading signal in the direction of the trend.
