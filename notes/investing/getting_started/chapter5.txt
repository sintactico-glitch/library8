- CHAPTER 5: CHART PATTERNS 

GAPS 

1. Common gap: usually occurs withing a trading range and isn't particularly significant.
2. Breakaway gap: occurs when prices go beyond a trading range. A breakaway gap that isn't fulled within a few days is one of the most significant and reliable chart signals.
3. Runaway gap: occurs when a trend accelerates and is a characteristic of strong bull or bear markets.
4. Exhaustion gap: occurs after an extended price move and is soon followed by a trend reversal. The difference between and exhaustion gap and a runaway gap is hindsight.

SPIKES 
 
A spike high is a day whose high is sharply above the high of the preceding and succeeding days. Sometimes spike highs will prove to be major tops. 

The significance of a spike high will be enhanced by:
- A wide difference between the spike high and the highs of the preceding and succeeding days
- A close near the low of the day's range
- An important price advance preceding the spike's formation

A spike low is a day whose low is sharly below the low of the preceding and suceeding days. Sometimes spike lows will prove to be major bottoms. 

REVERSAL DAYS 

- A reversal high day is a day that sees a new high in an upmove and then reverses to close below the preceding day's close. 
- A reversal low day is a day that sees a new low in a decline and then reverses to close above the preceding day's close. 

A reversal high day is generally interpreted as suggesting a buying climax and a relative high. However, reversal high days are failry common. 
Frequently, an uptrend will witness a number of reversal highs that prove to be false signals and then fail to register a reverseal high near the actual top. Reversal days provide occasional excellent signals, but far more frequent false signals.
