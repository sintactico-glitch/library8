LOVE LANGUAGE #4: ACTS OF SERVICE
The 5 Love Languages
Gary Chapman

Acts of service: doing things you know your partner would like you to do. You seek to please them by serving thme, to express your love for them by doing things for them. 

Love is always freely given. Love can't be demanded. We can request things of each other, but we must never demand anything. Requests give direction to love, but demands stop the flow of love. 

What we do for each other before marriage is no indication of what we will do after marriage. Before marriage, we're carried along by the force of the in-love obsession. After marriage, we revert to being the people we were before we "fell in love". Our actions are influenced by the model of our parents, our own personality, our perceptions of love, our emotions, needs, and desires. 

Love is a choice and can't be coerced. Criticism and demands tend to drive wedges. With enough criticism, you may get acquiescence from your spouse. They may do what you want, but probably it will not be an expression of love. 

    Each of us must decide daily to love or not to love our partner. If we choose to love, then expressing it in the way in which our partner requests will make our love most effective emotionally. 

My partner's criticisms about my behavior provide me the clearest clue to their primary love language. People tend to criticize their partner most loudly in the area where they themselves have the deepest emotional need. Their criticism is an ineffective way of pleading for love. 

If your partner's love language is Acts of Service:

- Make a list of all the request your partner hace made of you over the past few weeks. Select one of these each week and do it as an expression of love. 
- Ask your partner to make a list of 10 things they would like for you to do during the next month. Then ask them to prioritize those by numbering them 1-10. Use this list to plan your strategy for a month of love. 
- What one act of service has your partner nagged about consistently? If you choose to do it as an expression of love it would be of great significance to your partner. 
- Ask your partner to tell you the daily acts of service that would really speak love to them (cleaning the dishes, getting hairs out of the sink, hanging your clothes at night, for example). Work them into your daily schedule. "Little things" really do mean a lot. 
- Periodically ask your partner "If I could do one special act of service this week, what would you request?". If possible, do it and watch your partner's love tank fill up!
