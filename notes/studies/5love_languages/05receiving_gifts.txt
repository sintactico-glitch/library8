LOVE LANGUAGE #3: RECEIVING GIFTS
The 5 Love Languages
Gary Chapman

Could it be that gift giving is a fundamental expression of love that transcends cultural barriers? Is the attitude of love always accompanied by the concept of giving?

You must be thinking of someone to give them a gift. The gift itself is a symbol of that thought. It doesn't matter whether it costs money. What's important is that you thought of them.

    Gifts are visual symbols of love.
    Symbols have emotional value.

Physical presence in a time of crisis is the most powerful gift you can give if your partner's primary love language is receiving gifts. Your body becomes the symbol of your love. Remove the symbol, and the sense of love evaporates.

If your partner's love language is Receiving Gifts:

- Try a parade of gifts: a box of candy in the morning, flowers delivered in the afternoon, a shirt in the evening. 
- Give your partner a gift every day for one week. It doesn't need to be a special week, just any week. 
- Keep a "Gift Idea Notebook". Write down everything your partner mentions they like or they want. 
- If you don't know what to give your partner, ask their friends or family. 
- Offer the gift of presence. Go with your partner somewhere they want to go and really be there with them. 
- Give a living gift like a plant. You'll care for it together and enjoy watching it grow.
