KEEPING THE LOVE TANK FULL
The 5 Love Languages
Gary Chapman

Child psychologists affirm that every child has certain basic emotional needs that must be met if they're to be emotionally stable. Among those emotional needs, none is more basic than the need for love and affection, the need to sense taht they belong and are wanted. 

"Inside every child is an 'emotional tank' waiting to be filled with love. When a child really feels loved, they will develop normally but when the love tank is empty, the child will misbehave. Much of the misbehavior of children is motivated by the cravings of an empty 'love tank'."
- Dr. Ross Campbell

    The emotional need for love is not simply a childhood phenomenon. That need follows us into adulthood and into marriage. 
    The emotional need for love is fundamental to our nature. It's at the center of our emotional desires. 

People speak different love languages. We must be willing to learn our partner's primary love language if we're to be effective communicators of love.
