LOVE LANGUAGE #5: PHYSICAL TOUCH
The 5 Love Languages
Gary Chapman

Physical touch is a way of communicating emotional love. Holding hands, kissing, embracing, and sex are all ways of communicating emotional love to your partner. If your partner's primary love language is physical touch, they'll feel unloved without it. 

- Love touches may be explicit and demand your full attention like back rubs or sexual foreplay. 
- Love touches may be implicit and only require a moment, such as putting your hand on your partner's shoulder while you pour coffee or rubbing your body against them as you pass in the kitchen. 

Implicit love touches require little time but much thought, especially if physical touch is not your primary love language and if you didn't grow up in a "touching family".

    Whatever there is of me resides in my body. To touch my body is to touch me. To withdraw from my body is to distance yourself from me emotionally.     
    
Physical touch can make or break a relationship. It can communictae hate or love. 

CRISIS AND PHYSICAL TOUCH

Almost instinctively in a time of crisis, we hug one another. Why? Because physical touch is a powerful communicator of love. In a time of crisis, more than anyghing, we need to feel loved. We can't always change events, but we can survive if we feel loved. 

Crisis provide a unique opportunity for expressing love. Your tender touches will be remembered long after the crisis has passed. Your failure to touch may never be forgotten.

If your partner's lvoe language is Physical Touch:

- Hold hands with them as you walk around. 
- While eating together, let your knee or foot drift over and touch them. 
- Walk up behind your partner and initiate a shoulder massage. 
- Initiate sex by giving your partner a foot massage. 
- When family or friends are present, touch your partner in their presence (unless your partner doesn't want you to).
