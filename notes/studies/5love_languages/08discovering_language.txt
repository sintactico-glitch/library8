DISCOVERING YOUR PRIMARY LOVE LANGUAGE
The 5 Love Languages
Gary Chapman

When your partner's and your emotional tanks are full, and you're both speaking each others primary love language, the sexual aspect of the relationship will take care of itself. Most sexual problems in relationships have little to do with physical technique but everything to do with meeting emotional needs. 

To discover your love language ask yourself: 

1. What does my partner do or fail to do that hurts me most deeply? The opposite of what hurts you most is probably your love language. 
2. What have you most often requested of your partner? The thing you have most often requested is likely the thing that would make you feel most loved. 
3. In what way do you regularly expres love to your partner? Your method of expressing love may be an indication that that would also make you feel loved. 
4. What would be an ideal partner to me? If I could have the perfect partner, what would they be like? Your picture of a perfect partner should give you some idea of your primary love language. 

Write down what you think is your primary love language. Then list the other 4 in order of importance. Do the same with your partner's love languages, first the primary and then the other 4. 
Sit down with your partner and discuss what you guessed to be their primary love language. Then share what you consider to be your own  primary love language. 

ACTIONABLE STEPS

The "Tank Check" Game
When you come home, one of you asks the other "On a scale of 0 to 10, how is your love tank tonight?". They give you a reading on their emotional love tank. Then you ask "What could I do to help fill it?". 
Your partner will make a suggestion of something you they would like you to say or do that evening. To the best of your ability, respond to their request. Then you repeat the process in reverse order so that both of you have the opportunity to do a reading on your love tank and to make a suggestion toward filling it.
