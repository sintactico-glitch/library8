CHAPTER 3: TWO HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE NATURE OF LIFE ON Earth

There are many religions on Earth, and Gaia worship in some form or another is ancient. It arose as a celebration, and fear, of nature. The recent ideas and discoveries of scientists are being co-opted back into a New Age form of Gaia worship.

The inclusion of evolution as a required element of life on Earth must lead to certain behaviors of that life. These include:
- Competition even within a species
- Sometimes cannibalism
- The behavior of breeding to a resource-defined "carrying capacity". Any given species of life seems to breed not only up to the point where all resources are spoken for, but beyond that point, so there are more individuals than resources. 

GAIA HYPOTHESIS

Gaia Hypothesis: life improves the planet for itself, and for future life. The idea that the biomass of Earth life self-regulates the conditions on the planet to make its physical environment (in particular temperature and chemistry of the atmosphere) most hospitable to the species that constitutes its life. 

    A stronger claim appeared early in the history of the Gaia hypothesis that considered all life-forms part of a single planetary being, called Gaia. Lovelock no longer subscribes to this theory. 

Currently, there are many distinct categories of the Gaia hypothesis:

1. Optimizing Gaia
"Through Gaia theory, I see the Earth and the life it bears as a system, a system that has the capacity to regulate the temperature and composition of the Earth's surface and keep it comfortable for living organisms." (James Lovelock, 1988)
Another interpretation of this hypothesis is that the biomass alters conditions on Earth to increase the "hospitality" of the planet. However, there is a degree of circularity in the argument that the Earth is ideally suited for life, because the life present on Earth has had a long time to adapt to the very conditions on Earth. 

2. Self-regulating Gaia
This theory supposes that feedback systems allow the continuation of life on Earth by keeping life-constraining factor such as temperature and atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide levels within ranges that allow life. 
It has been interpreted in two ways:
- Life tends to make the environment stable, allowing all life to flourish.
- Life tends to make the environment stable IN ORDER for all life to flourish. This is an important distinction that implies intent 

3. Coevolutionary Gaia
It states that the biota and environment have evolved in tandem. This is the "weakest" hypothesis that is already viewed as true.

4. Progressive, Deterministic Gaia
Once life evolved, there were oly a few possible pathways for how life and its systems would evolve further. A small number of nutrient and element cycles that themselves affected later life. 

5. Garbage Can Gaia
The atmosphere is nothing but a giant waste dump. Life produces waste material in grate quantities, which build up and affect the environment and the organisms living in that environment. This was certainly the case when life began pouring oxygen into the atmosphere at a time when oxygen was poisonous to most life on Earth. 

6. Evolving Gaia
Proposed by Tim Lenton, this theory states that life didn't survive for over 3.8 billion years by chance, but rather because of the Earth system's regulatory mechanisms. The Earth system with life present is more resistant and resilient to many (but not all) perturbations, and the Earth is predicted to remain habitable for longer with life present than it would without.
