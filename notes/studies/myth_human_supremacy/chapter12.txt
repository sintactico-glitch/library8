THE MYTH OF HUMAN SUPREMACY
Derrick Jensen

CHAPTER 12: CONQUEST

Life itself is art. By destroying life, human supremacists are destroying the most beautiful and extraordinary innovations, creations, art. 

How could they do this? They value only themselves. What humans create has meaning. What nonhumans create does not. This is one reason this culture is so destructive. It is one reason it hates nature so much. The real world keeps reminding us that life is not all about us.
