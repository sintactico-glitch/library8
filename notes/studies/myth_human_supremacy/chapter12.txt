THE MYTH OF HUMAN SUPREMACY
Derrick Jensen

CHAPTER 12: CONQUEST

Life itself is art. By destroying life, human supremacists are destroying the most beautiful and extraordinary innovations, creations, art. 

How could they do this? They value only themselves. What humans create has meaning. What nonhumans create does not. This is one reason this culture is so destructive. It is one reason it hates nature so much. The real world keeps reminding us that life is not all about us. 

I find it extraordinary (and of course, entirely expected) that so many human supremacists happily speak of bending the entire world to "our" will, and attempt to force all of us to live with lees of the planet (and to force all those exterminated not to live at all), but then they freak out at the possibility of someone "commanding" them to live with fewer luxuries (luxuries that are gained by forcing others to bend to their will), and freak out as well at the possibility of reshaping this culture to be in line with the needs of the planet, the source of all life.
