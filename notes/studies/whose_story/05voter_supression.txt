- VOTER SUPPRESSION BEGINS AT HOME

There's a form of voter intimidation that is both widespread and unacknowledged. It's the husbands who bully and silence and control their wives.

The bullying seems to be mostly either to oblige the wife to lean to the right or not to participate at all (and though bullying from the left also exists, it hasn't been reported as a domestic issue). 

The violence in domestic violence is best understood as a subset of what is now called COERCIVE CONTROL: an attempt to dominate someone by means that are psychological (and may also be financial, physical, social and political) by preventing them from participating in the larger world and holding opinions of their own and exercising agency over their own bodies, lives, finances, truths. It makes perfect sense that this would apply to voting rights, since it can apply to anything and everything.
