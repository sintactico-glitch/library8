WHOSE STORY IS THIS?

- LIES BECOME LAWS

Anti-abortion laws are built on anti-abortion lies. Lies about things like who has abortions and why, how abortions work, how women's bodies work, and how fetuses are develop. This lies pave the way for the laws.

Criminalizing miscarriages means that those capable of being impregnated would, if they had sex with men, run the risk of being punished for common biological events beyond their control. In that world, it's conceivable that if the authorities know you're pregnant, thanks to medical visits (or fertility apps), you risk being charged with the "crime" of having a miscarriage or an abortion, which would be an incentive to avoid healthcare services.

It's another way to intrude into women's lives and terminate their rights. It puts women's lives in the hands of law enforcement and entangles medical decisions with bureaucracies and regulations.

I believe the hatred of abortion is often because it gives women an autonomy and freedom equivalent to that of men, and that hatred is often expressed by people who show no interest in the health of infants or wellbeing of children. Or women. And at this point, in science, facts and truth. Their lies pave the way for their laws.
