WHOSE STORY IS THIS?

- UNCONSCIOUS BIAS IS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT

With their deep belief in their own special monopoly on objectivity, slightly too many men assure me that there is no misogyny in their subjective assessments or even no subjectivity and no emotion driving them, and there are no grounds for other opinions since theirs is not an opinion.

They speak as if charisma or electability were objective qualities, and as if their own particular take on them were truth or fact rather than taste, and as if what white men like is what everyone likes, or as if white men are who matters, which is maybe a hangover from the long ugly era when only white men voted.

    Men assume that there are women who know too much (meaning they're intelligent) and the character defect is theirs, not his. The framework that intelligence is an asset in a man and a defect in a woman is nastily familiar.
