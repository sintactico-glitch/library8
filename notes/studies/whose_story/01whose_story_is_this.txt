WHOSE STORY IS THIS?

- WHOSE STORY (AND COUNTRY) IS THIS?

One of the battles of our time is about who the story is about, who matters, and who decides.

One way we know whose story it is has been demonstrated by who gets excused for hatred and attacks, literal or physical. And that has been white people in general and white men in particular, and especially straight white Protestant men. It's the population we're constantly asked to pay more attention to, and forgive, even when they hate us or seek to harm us.

Men are insisting on their comfort as a right. 

It reminds me of how young women pressing rape charges are often told they're harming the bright future of the rapist in question, rather than that maybe he did it to himself, and that the young woman's bright future should matter, too. 

This misdistribution of sympathy is epidemic.

Women have an internalized sense of responsability for men's needs. We are required to meet the needs of boys and men who may be hostile or homicidal. This framework suggests we owe them something, which feeds a sense of entitlement, which sets up the logic of payback for not delivering what they think we owe them.

    His desires must be met. Hers didn't count. 
    Women are not supposed to want things for themselves.

We are, as a culture, moving on to a future with more people and more voices and more possibilities. Some people are being left behind, not because the future is intolerant of them but because they are intolerant of this future.
