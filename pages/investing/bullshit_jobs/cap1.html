                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>Since there is such a thing as social value (apart from mere market value), but since no one has ever figured out an adequate way to measure it, the worker's perspective is about as close as one is likely to get to an accurate assessment of the situation. <strong>If the preponderance of those engaged in a certain occupation privately believe their work is of no social value, one should proceed along the assumption they are right</strong>.</p>

                  <div class="highlight">
                      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee <strong>cannot justify its existence</strong> even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee <strong>feels obliged to pretend</strong> that this is not the case.</p>
                  </div>

                  <p>Kings, earls, emperors, pasha, emirs, landlors and the like might, arguably, be useless people. Many of us would insist that they play pernicious roles in human affairs. But <em>they</em> don't think so.</p>

                  <p><strong>Most people who do a great deal of harm in the world are protected against the knowledge that they do so.</strong> The more harm a category of powerful people do in the world, the more yes-men and propagandist will tend to accumulate around them, coming up with reasons why they are really doing good - and the more likely it is that at least some of those powerful people will believe them.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Bullshit Jobs and Shit Jobs</h3>

                  <p>Three broad categories of jobs:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">Useful jobs (which may or not be shit jobs)</li>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">Bullshit jobs</li>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">A small but ugly group made up of people who are basically just selfish bastards and don't really pretend to be anything else (gangsters, slumlords, top corporate lawyers, hedge fund CEOs)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Bullshit jobs often pay quite well and tend to offer excellent working conditions. They're just pointless. <strong>Shit jobs</strong> are usually not at all bullshit; they <strong>typically involve work that needs to be done and is clearly of benefit to society</strong>. It's just that the workers who do them are paid and treated badly.</p>

                  <p>Shit jobs tend to be blue collar and pay by the hour, whereas bullshit jobs tend to be white collar and salaried. Those who work <strong>shit jobs tend to be the object of indignities</strong>; <em>they not only work hard but also are held in low esteem for that very reason</em>. But at least they know they're doing something useful. </p>
                      
                  <p>Those who work <strong>bullshit jobs are often surrounded by honor and prestige</strong>; they are respected as professionals, well paid, and treated as high achievers (the sort of people who can be justly proud of what they do). <strong>Yet secretly they are aware that they have achieved nothing</strong>. They feel they have done nothing to earn the consumer toys with which they fill their lives; they feel it's all based on a lie, and it is. <strong>These are two profoundly different forms of oppression.</strong> </p>

                  <div class="highlight">
                      <p>We have created societies where much of the population, trapped in useless employment, have come to resent and despise equally those who do the most useful work in society, and those who do no paid work at all. </p>
                  </div>

                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Bureaucracies</h3>
                  <p>Public and private bureaucracies have become so increasingly entangled that it's often very difficult to tell them apart. The assumption that government is necessarily top-heavy with an unnecessary levels of administrative hierarchy, while the private sector is lean and mean, is by now so firmly lodged in people's heads that it seems no amount of evidence will displodge it.</p>
                  <p>(The giant bureaucracy of the Soviet Union) is always represented as exactly what would never happen under capitalism. But, <strong>just as Socialist regimes had created millions of dummy proletarian jobs, capitalist regimens somehow ended up creating millions of dummy white-collar jobs instead</strong>.</p>                
                  <p>Beside government bureaucrats, when talking about bullshit jobs many will assume you must be talking about secretaries, receptionists and various sorts of (typically female) administrative staff. 
                  <p><strong>The assumption that it's mainly women who end up in bullshit jobs is not only sexist but also represents a profound ignorance of how most offices actually work</strong>. Men are far more likely to feel that their jobs are pointless (42%) than women do (32%) (the source is the YouGov survey).</p>
                  <p>There are very few jobs that don't involve at least a few pointless or idiotic elements. To some degree, this is probably just the inevitable side effect of the workings of any complex organization. The process of bullshitization is highly inconsistent. It has affected middle-class employment more than working-class employment. Within the working class, it has been traditionally female, caregiving work that has been the main target of bullshitization.</p>
                  <p>As a result, it's possible to say there are partly bullshit jobs, mostly bullshit jobs, and entirely bullshit jobs.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                      <p>If 37 to 40% of jobs are completely pointless, and at least 50% of the work done in nonpointless office jobs is equally pointless, we can probably conclude that <strong>at least half of all work being done in our society could be eliminated without making any real difference at all</strong>.</p>
