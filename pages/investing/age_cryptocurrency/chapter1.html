                <div class="subsection">
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">If citizens don't trust a government to represent their interests, they won't trust the monetary system around which their economy is organized. When given the chance, they will sell that currency for something they consider more trustworthy, like the US dollar or gold. </li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">The loss of value in its currency depletes the government's financial resources, which leaves money-printing as the only means to pay its debts and ensure political survival.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">That excess money in circulation further undermines trust, which gives way to a vicious cycle of spiraling inflation and plummeting exchange rates.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>For any currency to be viable, it must win the trust of the community using it. <strong>Trust is at the core of any system of money</strong>.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Bitcoin seeks to address this challenge by offering users <strong>a system of trust based not on human beings but on the inviolable laws of mathematics</strong>. However, many people don't trust it because of the overall image of bitcoin (insecurity, volatility). Others are scared of the notion that computers and not humans are running things.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h4 class="summary__title--subtitle">What is Money?</h4>
                  <p>In <cite>Money: The Unathorized Biography</cite>, Felix Martin argues that to focus on money as a "thing" (metallist conception of money) is to miss the powerful, civilization-building force that this invention unleashed. </p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p><strong>Money as a social technology.</strong> Currency is not itself money. Money is the system of credit accounts and their clearing that currency represents. </p>
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>Money provided a universal value system</strong>. This meant that power structures in prehistoric tribal communities (based on violence from the most physically powerful) could give way to something that allowed all members of society to thrive. The accumulation of this new, abstract measure of value would become the benchmark of power. </p>
                  <p>As a material object, little is unique about any country's banknotes. If you deposit a dollar note in your account, the bank acknowledges that it owes you that dollar. But this really doesn't resolve the problem of what gives the dollar its value.</p>
                  <p><strong>Its value depends entirely upon everyone else consensually recognizing that your dollar can be redeemed for an agreed-upon measure of goods and services.</strong></p>
                  <p>If that consensus were to disappear, your dollar's value would fall away very quickly, like with the argentine peso. <strong>A dollar's value hinges on society's willingness to accept it in settlement of a debt</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Gold's value as currency is an abstract social construct. It's valuable because we believe it's valuable. This agreement is what gives it value, gold doesn't have intrinsic value. </p>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h4 class="summary__title--subtitle">Metallism Versus Chartalism</h4>
                  <p>Metallism:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Money as a commodity, a preexisting thing with its own inherent value.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Societies choose certain commodities as units of exchange to simplify trade.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Currency should itself be, or be backed by, some tangible material.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Chartalism:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Looks past the currency and focuses on the credit and trust relationships between the individual and society at large that currency embodies.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Recognizes the presence of an implicit, societywide agreement that allows monetary exchange to perpetuate and debt and credit to be issued and cleared. This negotiated solution <em>is money</em>. It's not the currency. The currency is a token or symbol around which this complex system is arranged.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This debate is also present around cryptocurrencies:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Metallist treated the digital currency as a scarce commodity, a <strong>thing</strong> to be mined and stored. A thing whose mathematically proven finite supply ensures its value will rise above the unlimited fiat currencies.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Chartalist describe bitcoin not as a currency but as a <strong>payment protocol</strong>. They're more concerned with the underlying computer network's capacity to rearrange the rules of trust around which society manages exchanges of value. They see money as a system for settling and recording debt obligations.</li>
                  </ul>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h4 class="summary__title--subtitle">The Role of Government</h4>
                  <p>Metallists consider that governments simply played an endorsement role, authenticating the quality and quantity of metal in each coin. For chartalists, the state evolved to become the ultimate clearinghouse for debts and credits through its monopoly over taxes, which could only be paid in the coin of the realm.</p>
                  <p><strong>For most of its history, currency has been issued by those who rule</strong>, kings or democratically elected governments. These rulers have stamped their authority on their currency, reminding citizens of the deep connection between money and power. </p>
                  <p>Artistic imagery on currency helps avoid counterfeit and it also supports the fiction that a money token has intrinsic value. It gives the coin authenticity and it works as an advertisement of the omnipresence of the realm.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h4 class="summary__title--subtitle">Central Banks</h4>
                  <p>The rulers in each land kept tight control over their currencies, but <strong>the new banking class during the Italian Renaissance developed its own international exchanges through credit creation</strong>.</p>
                  <p>We can trace this back to the creation of the Bank of England in 1694:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">The Bank of England was created on behalf of King William III, that wanted to build a ship to take to France.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">The Bank was privately owned and it lent the Crown 1.2 million pounds, after which they could issue banknotes against that debt. Meaning they were relending the money.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">To give the banknotes value as currency, the Crown agreed to accept them in payment of taxes.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">This gave the Bank of England a licence to print money.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">The relending of most of the money they take in is something banks continue to do to this day.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>This financial leap gave a giant boost to liquidity in the economy, but it also greatly increased risk. Losses in one institution could ripple out and destabilize many others through the interconnections of the financial system. This made trust very unstable.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h4 class="summary__title--subtitle">Money to Currency</h4>
                  <p>For a currency to become money it must function as:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">a medium of exchange</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">a unit of account</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">a store of value</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>What matters most is whether that currency has utility. Does it enhance our ability to engage in exchange, commerce and human interaction?</p>
                  <p>Bitcoin has something to offer: a remarkable capacity to <strong>facilitate low-cost, near-instant transfer of value anywhere in the world</strong>.</p>
                  <p>A large community of Bitcoin users could be the push it needs to become money. </p>
