                <h2 class="summary__title--main">Preface: On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs</h2>
                
                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>Over the course of the last century, as predicted, <strong>productive jobs have been largely automated away</strong>. Rather than allowing a massive reduction of working hours to free the world's population to pursue their own projects, pleasures, visions and ideas, we've seen the <strong> ballooning of the administrative sector</strong>, up to and including the creation of whole new industries (financial services, telemarketing, corporate law, academic and health administration, human resources, public relations).</p>

                  <p>If someone had designed a work regime perfectly suited to maintaining the power of finance capital, it's hard to see how they could have done a better job:</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Real, <strong>productive workers</strong> are relentlessly squeezed and exploited. The remainder are divided between </li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">A terrorized stratum of the universally reviled <strong>unemployed</strong> and </li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">A <strong>larger stratum who are basically paid to do nothing</strong>, in positions designed to identify with the perspectives and sensibilities of the ruling class. But at the same time, foster a simmering resentment against anyone whose work has a clear and undeniable social value</li>
                </ul>

                <p>It's as if someone were out there <strong>making up pointless jobs just for the sake of keeping us all working.</strong> The ruling class has figured out that a happy and productive population with free time on their hands is a mortal danger.</p>

                <div class="highlight">
                    <p>One possible vision of hell: a collection of individuals who are spending the bulk of their time working on a task they don't like and are not especially good at.</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>There seems to be a general rule that, <strong>the more obviously one's work benefits other people, the less one is likely to be paid for it</strong>. Even more perverse, there seems to be a broad sense that <em>this is the way things should be</em>. This is one of the secret strengths of right-wing populism. </p>
                  
                <div class="highlight">
                    <p><strong>Q:</strong> What does it say about our society that it seems to generate an extremely limited demand for talented poet-musicians but an apparently infinite demand for specialists in corporate law?</p>
                    <p><strong>A:</strong> If 1% of the population controls most of the disposable wealth, <strong>what we call "the market" reflects what they think is useful or important</strong>, not anybody else.</p>
                </div>

                <p>If a private company hired a consultant to come up with a business plan, and it resulted in a sharp decline in profits, that consultant would be fired. With free market reforms, this never seemed to happen. The more they failed, the more they were enacted. The only logical conclusion was that the economic imperatives weren't really driving the project.</p>

                <p><strong>Millions of people spend their working lives performing tasks they secretly believe do not really need to be performed.</strong></p>

                <p>We have come to believe that men and women who don not work harder than they wish at jobs they do not particularly enjoy are bad people unworthy of love, care, or assistance from their communities. <strong>It's as if we have collectively acquiesced to our own enslavement.</strong> As a result, <em>hatred, resentment, and suspicion have become the glue that holds society together</em>. </p>

                </div>

                <h2 class="summary__title--main">Chapter 1: What is a Bullshit Job?</h2>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>Since there is such a thing as social value (apart from mere market value), but since no one has ever figured out an adequate way to measure it, the worker's perspective is about as close as one is likely to get to an accurate assessment of the situation. <strong>If the preponderance of those engaged in a certain occupation privately believe their work is of no social value, one should proceed along the assumption they are right</strong>.</p>

                  <div class="highlight">
                      <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee <strong>cannot justify its existence</strong> even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee <strong>feels obliged to pretend</strong> that this is not the case.</p>
                  </div>

                  <p>Kings, earls, emperors, pasha, emirs, landlors and the like might, arguably, be useless people. Many of us would insist that they play pernicious roles in human affairs. But <em>they</em> don't think so.</p>

                  <p><strong>Most people who do a great deal of harm in the world are protected against the knowledge that they do so.</strong> The more harm a category of powerful people do in the world, the more yes-men and propagandist will tend to accumulate around them, coming up with reasons why they are really doing good - and the more likely it is that at least some of those powerful people will believe them.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Bullshit Jobs and Shit Jobs</h3>

                  <p>Three broad categories of jobs:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">Useful jobs (which may or not be shit jobs)</li>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">Bullshit jobs</li>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">A small but ugly group made up of people who are basically just selfish bastards and don't really pretend to be anything else (gangsters, slumlords, top corporate lawyers, hedge fund CEOs)</li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>Bullshit jobs often pay quite well and tend to offer excellent working conditions. They're just pointless. <strong>Shit jobs</strong> are usually not at all bullshit; they <strong>typically involve work that needs to be done and is clearly of benefit to society</strong>. It's just that the workers who do them are paid and treated badly.</p>

                  <p>Shit jobs tend to be blue collar and pay by the hour, whereas bullshit jobs tend to be white collar and salaried. Those who work <strong>shit jobs tend to be the object of indignities</strong>; <em>they not only work hard but also are held in low esteem for that very reason</em>. But at least they know they're doing something useful. </p>
                      
                  <p>Those who work <strong>bullshit jobs are often surrounded by honor and prestige</strong>; they are respected as professionals, well paid, and treated as high achievers (the sort of people who can be justly proud of what they do). <strong>Yet secretly they are aware that they have achieved nothing</strong>. They feel they have done nothing to earn the consumer toys with which they fill their lives; they feel it's all based on a lie, and it is. <strong>These are two profoundly different forms of oppression.</strong> </p>

                  <div class="highlight">
                      <p>We have created societies where much of the population, trapped in useless employment, have come to resent and despise equally those who do the most useful work in society, and those who do no paid work at all. </p>
                  </div>

                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Bureaucracies</h3>
                  <p>Public and private bureaucracies have become so increasingly entangled that it's often very difficult to tell them apart. The assumption that government is necessarily top-heavy with an unnecessary levels of administrative hierarchy, while the private sector is lean and mean, is by now so firmly lodged in people's heads that it seems no amount of evidence will displodge it.</p>
                  <p>(The giant bureaucracy of the Soviet Union) is always represented as exactly what would never happen under capitalism. But, <strong>just as Socialist regimes had created millions of dummy proletarian jobs, capitalist regimens somehow ended up creating millions of dummy white-collar jobs instead</strong>.</p>                
                  <p>Beside government bureaucrats, when talking about bullshit jobs many will assume you must be talking about secretaries, receptionists and various sorts of (typically female) administrative staff. 
                  <p><strong>The assumption that it's mainly women who end up in bullshit jobs is not only sexist but also represents a profound ignorance of how most offices actually work</strong>. Men are far more likely to feel that their jobs are pointles (42%) than women do (32%) (the source is the YouGov survey).</p>
                  <p>There are very few jobs that don't involve at least a few pointless or idiotic elements. To some degree, this is probably just the inevitable side effect of the workings of any complex organization. The process of bullshitization is highly inconsistent. It has affected middle-class employment more than working-class employment. Within the working class, it has been traditionally female, caregiving work that has been the main target of bullshitization.</p>
                  <p>As a result, it's possible to say there are partly bullshit jobs, mostly bullshit jobs, and entirely bullshit jobs.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                      <p>If 37 to 40% of jobs are completely pointless, and at least 50% of the work done in nonpointless office jobs is equally pointless, we can probably conclude that <strong>at least half of all work being done in our society could be eliminated without making any real difference at all</strong>.</p>

                <h2 class="summary__title--main">Chapter 2: What Sorts of Bullshit Jobs Are There?</h2>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Flunkies</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">Flunky jobs are those that exist only or primarily to make someone else look or feel important</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Throughout recorded history, rich and powerful men and women have tended to surround themselves with servants, clients, and minions of one sort of another. Assigning people minor tasks as an excuse to have them around making you look impressive has a long and honorable history.</p>
                    <p><strong>To be an aristocrat meant to have the power to order others around.</strong> An analogous logic seems to be at work in corporate environments.</p>

                    <p>Examples of flunkies:  Doormen, receptionists and front-desk personnel at places that obviously don't need them</p>
                    
                    <div class="highlight">
                        <p><strong>Q:</strong> Why shell out a full-time salary and benefits for a woman just to sit at the front desk all day doing nothing? </p>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> Because not doing so would be shocking and bizarre. No one would take a company seriously if it had no one at all sitting at the front desk.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Managers off-load more and more of their responsabilities onto the lowest-ranking subordinate to give the impression that they were too busy to do such things themselves. Leading, of course, to their having even less to do than previously. A spiral culminating in the apparently bizarre decision to hire another manager to stare at the wall, just because hiring him would make it look like that was not what everyone else was doing. <strong>Whose job is really bullshit, the flunky's or the boss'?</strong></p>

                    <p>The flunkies end up effectively doing the bosses' jobs for them. This was the traditional role of female secretaries (administrative assistants) working for male executives during most of the 20th century. </p>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        <p>The middle manager staring at the wall all day may or may not have been willling to admit his job was pointless. But <strong>those hired just to make someone like him seem important almost invariably know it and resent it</strong>.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>This creates an even more powerful incentive for those on top of the organizational ladder to hire more employees and only then decide what they are going to do, or to resist any efforts to eliminate jobs that are found to be redundant. <strong>For without flunkies, to whom, exactly, would they be "superior"?</strong></p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Goons</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">Goons are people whose jobs have an aggresive element but, crucially, exist only because other people employ them</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Example: national armed forces. Countries need armies only because other countries have armies. If no one had an army, armies would not be needed. Same of most lobbyist, PR specialists, telemarketers and corporate lawyers. Like literal goons, all have a <strong>largely negative impact on society.</strong></p>
                    <p>Goons have bullshit jobs because so many of those who have these type of work feel their jobs have no social value and ought not to exist. Most times these jobs also involve <strong>manipulative and aggressive tactics</strong>.</p>
                    
                    <div class="highlight">
                        <p>"I consider a worthwhile job to be one that fulfills a preexisting need, or creates a product or service that people hadn't thought of, that somehow enhances and improves their lives. <strong>I believe we passed the point where most jobs were these types of jobs a long time ago.</strong> Supply has far outpaced demand in most industries, so now it is demand that is manufactured.</p>
                        <p>If we're at the point where in order to sell products, you have to first of all trick people into thinking they need them, then I think you'd be hard-pressed to argue that these jobs aren't bullshit."</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>Another example are call center employees. Most times, the work involves <strong>tricking or pressuring people into doing things that aren't really in their best interest</strong>. What really irks is </p>

                        <li class="summary__list-item">the deception.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>There are few things less pleasant than being forced against your better nature to try to convince others to do things that defy their common sense.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Duct Tapers</h3>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">Duct tapers are there to solve a problem that ought not to exist. Underlings whose jobs are to undo the damage done by sloppy or incompetent superiors</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>It's a term that comes from the software industry. With the growing reliance on free software, paid employment is increasingly reduced to duct taping.</p>
                    <p>Another example is cleaning. Cleaning is a necessary function. But cleaning up after someone who makes a completely gratitous and unnecesary mess is always irritating. Having a full-time occupation cleaning up after such a person can only breed resentment.</p>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        <p>Many duct-taper jobs are a result of a glitch in the system that no one has bothered to correct - task that could easily be automated but haven't been for any reason.</p>
                    </div>
                
                    <p>On the social level, duct taping has <strong> traditionally been women's work</strong>. In a more material sense, duct taping might be considered a <strong>classic working-class function</strong>.</p>

                    <p>There will always be a certain gap between blueprints, and plans and their real-world implementation. Therefore, there will always be people charged with making the necessary adjustments. </p>
                    <p>What makes such a role bullshit is when the plan obviously is so stupidly designed that it will fail in completely predictable ways, but rather than fix the problem, the organization prefers to hire full-time employees whose entire job is to deal with the damage. <strong>Duct tapers are almost always aware they have a bullshit job and are usually quite angry about it. </strong></p>

                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Box Tickers</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">Box tickers are employees who exist only or primarily to allow an organization to be able to claim it's doing something that, in fact, it's not doing. We're all familiar with box ticking as a form of government, but large corporations will behave in the same way</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The most miserable thing about box-ticking jobs is that the employee is usually aware that <strong>not only does the box-ticking exercise do nothing toward accomplishing its ostentible purpose, it actually undermines it, since it diverts time and resources away from the purpose itself</strong>.</p>

                    <p>These type of works also involves creating presentations. It's very easy to charge a large amount of money to write bullshit reports. The physical attractiveness of the reports is fundamental.</p>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        <p>If the ongoing importance of a manager is measured by how many people they have working under them, the immediate material manifestation of that manager's power and prestige is the visual quality of their presentations and reports. <strong>The meetings in which such emblems are displayed might be considered the high rituals of the corporate world.</strong></p>

                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Taskmasters</h3>
                    <p>Taskmasters fall into 2 subatgories:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">Those whose role consist entirely of <strong>assigning work to others</strong>. This job can be bullshit if the taskmaster believes that there is no need for their intervention, and that the underlings would be perfectly capable of carrying on with their work without them. They're unnecessary superiors rather than unnecessary subordinates</li>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">Those whose primary role is to <strong>create bullshit tasks for others to do, to supervise bullshit or even to create entirely new bullshit jobs</strong>.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <div class="highlight">
                        <p>The entire job of middle management is to ensure the lower-level people hit their "productivity numbers", and will therefore start coming up with formal statistical metrics that their underlings can try to falsify.</p>
                    </div>

                    <p>It's not capitalism per se that produces the bullshit. It's managerialist ideologies put into practice in complex organizations:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>The creation of a bullshit job often involves creating a whole universe of bullshit narrative</strong> that documents the purpose and functions of the position as well as the qualifications required to successfully perform the job, while also adhiering to the buraucratic requirements of HR</li>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">Once that's done, there has to be a narrative job announcement </li>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">To be eligible for hire, the applicant must present a resume incorporating the themes and phrasology of the announcement to be considered</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>It can also sometimes be clear that a job is bullshit but still be difficult to determine precisely which of the 5 categories it belongs to. Often it may seem to contain elements of several.</p>
                    <p>Only one class of people that not only denied their jobs were pointless but expressed outright hostility to the very idea that our economy is filled with bullshit jobs: <strong>business owners and anyone else in charge of hiring and firing.</strong></p>
