                <p>Since at least the Great Depression, we've been hearing warnings that automation was about to cause mass unemployment. And <strong>automation did lead to mass unemployment</strong>. We have simply stopped it by adding dummy jobs that are effectively made up.</p>
                <p>The giant bureaucracy of the Soviet Union is always represented as exactly what would never happen under capitalism. But, <strong>just as Socialist regimes had created millions of dummy proletarian jobs, capitalist systems somehow ended up creating millions of dummy white-collar jobs instead</strong>.</p>
                <p>A bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case.</p>
                <p>We have created societies where much of the population, trapped in useless employment, have come to resent and despise equally those who do the most useful work in society, and those who do no paid work at all. As a result, hatred, resentment, and suspicion have become the glue that holds society together. </p>
                <p><strong>It's as if someone were out there making up pointless jobs just for the sake of keeping us all working</strong>.</p>
                <p>Working serves a purpose, or is meant to do so. Being forced to pretend to work just for the sake of working is an indignity, since the demand is perceived as the pure excercise of power for its own sake.</p>
                
                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">The Meaning of Work</h4>
                <p>Our society has reached the point where <strong>not only is the social value of work usually in inverse proportion to its economic value, but many people have come to accept this situation as morally right, they believe this is how things should be</strong>. That we should reward useless or even destructive behavior and punish those whose daily labors make the world a better place.</p>
                <p>The less the value of work is seen to lie either in what it produces, or the benefits it provides to others, the more work comes to be seen as valuable primarily as a <strong>form of self-sacrifice</strong>, which means that anything that makes that work more enjoyable (even the gratification of knowing that one's work benefits others) is actually seen to lower its value, and as a result, to justify lower levels of pay. </p>
                <p>The main rule is that anyone pursuing a useful or high-minded line of work, but who also expects comfortable levels of pay and benefits is a legitimate target of resentment.</p>
                <p>There's a <strong>very long theological tradition of valorizing work as a sacred duty, at once a curse and blessing, and seeing humans as inherently sinful, lazy beings</strong> who can be expected to shirk that duty if they can. Many economic concepts trace back directly to religious ideas.</p>
                <p>There seems to be a broad consensus not so much that work is good but that not working is very bad, that <strong>anyone who is not slaving away harder than they'd like at something they don't especially enjoy is a bad person, a parasite</strong> unworthy of sympathy or public relief.</p>
                <p>The message of the modern "If you have time to lean, you have time to clean" is <strong>not that you should be working but that you shouldn't be doing anything else</strong>.</p>
                <p>The idea is that dutiful submission even to meaningless work under another's autority is a form of moral self-discipline that makes you a better person. What "proper work ethic" means is <strong>obedience</strong>.</p>
                
                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Managerial Feudalism</h4>
                <p>Under classic capitalist conditions it makes no sense to hire unnecessary workers. Maximizing profits means paying the least number of workers the least amount of money possible. In a very competitive market, those who hire unnecessary workers are not likely to survive. So our economy can't be riddled with bullshit jobs, it must be an illusion.</p>
                <p>If the existence of bullshit jobs seems to defy the logic of capitalism, one possible reason might be that <strong>the existing system isn't capitalism</strong>.</p>
                <p>It's a system of rent extraction where the internal logic is profoundly different from capitalism, since economic and political imperatives merge. <strong>It resembles classic medieval feudalism, displaying the same tendency to create endless hierarchies of lords, vassals and retainers</strong>.</p>
                <p>The whole point is to grab a pot of loot (stealing it from enemies or extracting it from commoners by fees, rents and taxes), and the redistributing it. In the process, one creates an entourage of followers that is a visible measure of one's pomp and magnificence. And at the same time, it's a means of distributing political favor (buying off malcontent, rewarding faithful allies and creating a elaborate hierarchy of honors and titles for lower-rank nobles to fight over).</p>
                <p>When a profit-seeking enterprise is in the business of distributing a very large sum of money, the most profitable thing for it to do is to be as inefficient as possible. This is basically what the FIRE (Finance, Insurance, Real Estate) sector does: it creates money (by making loans) and then moves it around in often extemely complicated ways, extracting a small cut with every transaction.</p>
