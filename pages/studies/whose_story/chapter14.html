                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>We are not very good at telling stories about a hundred people doing things or considering that the qualities that matter in saving a valley or changing the world are mostly not physical courage and athletic violence but the ability to coordinate and inspire and connect with lots of other people and create stories about what could be and how we get there.</p>
                  <p><strong>Positive social change results mostly from connecting more deeply to the people around you than rising above them, from coordinated rather than solo action</strong>. Among the virtues that matter are those traditionally considered feminine rather than masculine, more nerd than jock: listening, respect, patience, negotiation, strategic planning, storytelling. But we like our lone and exceptional heroes, the drama of violence and virtue of muscle, or at least that’s what we get, over and over, and from it we don’t get much of a picture of how change actually happens and what our role in it might be, or how ordinary people matter. </p>
                  <p>We need hope and purpose and membership in a community beyond the nuclear family. This connection is both personally fulfilling and is also how we get stuff done that needs to be done. <strong>Lone hero narratives push one figure into the public eye, but they push everyone else back into private life, or at least passive life</strong>.</p>
                  <p>The problem of the singlehanded hero exists in nonfiction and news and even history (where it was dubbed the “great man theory of history”) as much as it does in fiction and film. </p>
                  <p>We like heroes and stars and their opposites, though I’m not sure who I mean by <em>we</em>, except maybe the people in charge of too many of our stories, themselves often elites who believe devoutly in elites, which is what heroes and stars are often presumed to be.</p>
                  <p>It’s a caustic revision of the hero as an attention-getter, a party-crasher, a fame-seeker, and, at least implicitly, a troublemaker in the guise of a problem-solver. <strong>And maybe we as a society are getting tired of heroes, and a lot of us are certainly getting tired of overconfident white men</strong>. Even the idea that the solution will be singular and dramatic and in the hands of one person <strong>erases that the solutions to problems are often complex and many-faceted and arrived at via negotiations</strong>.</p>
                  <p>That’s another part of our rugged individualism and hero culture, the idea that all problems are personal and they’re all soluble by personal responsibility. It’s a framework that eliminates the possibility of deeper, broader change or of holding accountable the powerful who create and benefit from the status quo and its myriad forms of harm. The narrative of individual responsibility and change protects stasis, whether it’s adapting to inequality or poverty or pollution.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Our largest problems won’t be solved by heroes. They’ll be solved, if they are, by movements, coalitions, civil society.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>A general is not much without an army, and social change is not even modeled on generals and armies, because the outstanding figures get others to act willingly, not by command. We would do well to call them catalysts rather than leaders. Martin Luther King Jr. was not the civil rights movement and Cesar Chavez was not the farmworker rights movement, and to mistake them for that denies the multitudes the recognition they deserve. More important, it denies us strategic understanding when we need it most. Which begins with our own power and ends with how change works.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>The prevailing ethos seems to be that so long as there is somebody else out there who is capable of <em>Doing Something</em>, the rest of us are free to desist. Leaders beget followers, and followers are people who've surrendered some of their capacities to think and act.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>The standard action movie narrative requires one exceptional person in the foreground, which requires the rest of the characters to be on the spectrum from useless to clueless to wicked, plus a few moderately helpful auxiliary characters. Classic disaster movies begin with a sudden upset in the order of things (the tower becomes a towering inferno, the meteor heads toward Earth, the Earth shakes) and then smooth it all over with a kind of father-knows-best, here-comes-a-hero plotline of rescuing helpless women and subduing vicious men. <strong>Patriarchal authority itself is shown as the solution to disasters, or as a sort of drug to make us feel secure despite them</strong>.</p>
                  <p>That is, I found in disasters a window onto what so many of us really want and don’t get, a need we hardly name or recognize. There are not a lot of movies that can even imagine this profound emotion I think of as public love , this sense of meaning, purpose, power, belonging to a community, a society, a city, a movement.</p>
