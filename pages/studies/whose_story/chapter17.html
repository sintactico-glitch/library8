                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>What climate activists are asking for is a profound change in all our energy systems, for leaving fossil fuel in the ground, for taking action adequate to the planet-scale crisis of climate change. And the rules we are so often reminded of by those who aren’t ready for change are not the real rules. </p>
                  <p>They will tell you the rules are that those we see in the news and the parliaments and boardrooms hold all the power and you must be nice to them and perhaps they will give you crumbs, or the time of day, or just a door slammed in your face. They will tell you that things can only change in tiny increments by predictable means. They’re wrong. Sometimes you don’t have to ask for permission, or for anything, because you hold the power and you yourselves decide which way the door swings. Nothing is possible without action; almost anything is when we rise up together, as you are doing today.</p>
                  <p>To see what were once radical new ideas about gender and sexual orientation and race, about justice and equality, about nature and ecology become ordinary accepted ideas—and then to see people forget how our minds were changed, and how much that process matters, too.</p>
                  <p>That a Black woman born in Tuskegee, Alabama, in 1913 would influence a white girl born in Sweden ninety years later to take direct action about climate change is a reminder that everything is connected and your actions matter even when the results aren’t immediate or obvious. The way Rosa Parks broke the rules and lived according to her ideals still matters, still has power, still has influence beyond what she could have imagined, beyond her lifetime, beyond her continent, beyond her particular area of activism.</p>
                  <p>The real lesson of history is that change often comes in unpredictable ways; power can suddenly be in the hands of those who appear out of what seems to the rest of us like nowhere. </p>
