                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>Acts of service: doing things you know your partner would like you to do. <strong>You seek to please them by serving them, to express your love for them by doing things for them</strong>. </p>
                  <p>Love is always freely given. Love can't be demanded. We can request things of each other, but we must never demand anything. Requests give direction to love, but demands stop the flow of love. </p>
                  <p>What we do for each other before marriage is no indication of what we will do after marriage. Before marriage, we're carried along by the force of the in-love obsession. After marriage, we revert to being the people we were before we "fell in love". Our actions are influenced by the model of our parents, our own personality, our perceptions of love, our emotions, needs, and desires. </p>
                  <p><strong>Love is a choice and can't be coerced</strong>. Criticism and demands tend to drive wedges. With enough criticism, you may get acquiescence from your spouse. They may do what you want, but probably it will not be an expression of love. </p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Each of us must decide daily to love or not to love our partner. If we choose to love, then expressing it in the way in which our partner requests will make our love most effective emotionally. </p>
                  </div>
                  <p><strong>My partner's criticisms about my behavior provide me the clearest clue to their primary love language</strong>. People tend to criticize their partner most loudly in the area where they themselves have the deepest emotional need. Their criticism is an ineffective way of pleading for love. </p>
