                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>Quality time doesn't mean that we have to spend our together moments gazing into each other's eyes. It means <strong>we're doing something together and that we're giving our full attention to the other person</strong>. The activity is a vehicle that creates a sense of togetherness. </p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>When we sit and talk for 20 minutes deeply engaged with one another, we're giving each other 20 minutes of life. We're giving our lives to each other. This is a powerful emotional communicator of love.</p>

                  <h4 class="summary__title--subtitle">Quality Conversation</h4>
                  <p>Quality conversation: sympathetic dialogue where 2 individuals are sharing their experiences, thoughts, feelings and desires in a friendly, uninterrupted context. </p>
                  <p>Quality conversation is quite different from the first love language. Words of affirmation focus on what we're <em>saying</em>; quality conversation focuses on what we're <em>hearing</em>.</p>
                  <p><strong>A relationship calls for sympathetic listening with a view to understanding the other person's thoughts, feelings, and desires</strong>. We must be willing to give advice but only when it's requested and never in a condescending manner.</p>

                        <li class="summary__list-item">Don't listen to your partner and do something else at the same time. </li>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">Listen for feelings. Ask yourself, "What emotion is my partner experiencing?". When you think you have the answer, confirm it asking them about it. </li>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">Observe body language. Ask for clarification to make sure you know what they're really thinking and feeling.</li>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">Refuse to interrupt them. The goal is to understand them, not to defend ourselves or correct them. </li>

                  <h4 class="summary__title--subtitle">Learning to Talk</h4>
                  <p>Quality conversation requires not only sympathetic listening but also <strong>self-revelation</strong>. In each of life's events, we have emotions, thoughts, desires and eventually actions. It's the expression of that process taht we call self-revelation. </p>
                  <p>If you need to learn the language of quality conversation, begin by noting the emotions you feel: 3 times a day, ask yourself: "What emotions have I felt in the last 3 hours?". This allows you to develop an awareness of your emotional nature. For example: </p>
                  <table class="table">
                    <thead>
                      <th>Event</th>
                      <th>Emotion</th>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Traffic</td>
                        <td>Anger/frustration</td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td>Boss moving a deadline</td>
                        <td>Anxious/dissapointment</td>
                      </tr>
                    </tbody>
                  </table>
                  <p>Using your list, communicate your emotions and the events briefly with your partner as many days as possible. In a few weeks, you'll become comfortable expressing your emotions with them.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>One way to learn new patterns is to establish a daily sharing time in which each of you will talk about 3 things that happenned to you that day and how you feel about them.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h4 class="summary__title--subtitle">Quality Activities</h4>
                  <p>Quality activities may include anything in which one or both of you have an interest. The emphasis is not on what you're doing but on why you're doing it. </p>
                  <p>The essential ingredients in a quality activity are:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">At least one of you wants to do it. </li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">The other is willing to do it. </li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Both of you know why you're doing it: to express love by being together. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>One of the by-products of quality activites is that they provide a memory bank from which to draw in the years ahead. </p>

What's the worst mistake your mother/father ever made?). After answering the 5 questions, stop and decide on the 5 questions you'll ask next time. </li>
