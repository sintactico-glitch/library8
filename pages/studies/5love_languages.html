                <p>The emotional need for love is one of our most basic needs, starting in childhood and continuing in our adult relationships. We all have a "love tank" that we need to have full to have fulfilling connections with others around us.</p>
                <p>The "in love" experience is euphoric. We're emotionally obsessed with each other, we feel altruistic toward each other, we feel we belong together. Our emotional needs are being met fully during this time.</p>
                <p>Once the experience of falling in love has run its natural course (average of 2 years), we will return to the world of reality and begin to assert ourselves. </p>
                <p>People have different love languages. If after the "in love" phase we don't learn how to speak our partner's love language, we'll drift appart, separate and begin looking for a new "in love" experience with someone new. </p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Love Language #1: Words Of Affirmation</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Words that build up, verbal compliments</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Encouraging words. Encouraging requires empathy, seeing the world from your partner's perspective</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">The way we express our desires is important. Love makes requests, not demands. <strong>When I demand things from my partner, I become a parent and they the child</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Love Language #2: Quality Time</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Doing something together and giving our full attention to the other person. The activity is a vehicle that creates a sense of togetherness</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Quality conversation: sympathetic listening with a view to understanding the other person's thoughts, feelings and desires</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Quality conversations require <strong>sympathetic listening and self-revelation</strong>. The expression of our thoughts, emotions and desires to our partner</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Quality activities may include anything that one or both partners have an interest in doing. It's important both of you know why you're doing it: to express  love by being together</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Love Language #3: Receiving Gifts</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">You must be thinking of someone to give them a gift. The gift itself is a symbol of that thought</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>Gifts are visual symbols of love. Symbols have emotional value</strong></li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Physical presence in a time of crisis is the most powerful gift you can give if your partner's primary love language is receiving gifts. Your body becomes a symbol of your love. Remove the symbol, and the sense of love evaporates</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Love Language #4: Acts of Service</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Acts of service: doing things you know your partner would like you to do. You seek to please them by serving them, to express your love for them by doing things for them</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Love is a choice and can't be coerced. Criticism and demands tend to drive wedges. With enough criticism, you may get what you want but it will not be an expression of love</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>My partner's criticisms about my behavior provide me the clearest clue to their primary love language</strong>. People tend to criticize their partner most loudly in the area where they themselves have the deepest emotional need. Their criticism is an ineffective way of pleading for love</li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Love Language #5: Physical Touch</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Physical touch is a way of communicating emotional love</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>Whatever there is of me resides in my body. To touch my body is to touch me. To withdraw from my body is to distance yourself from me emotionally</strong></li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Physical touch can make or break a relationship. It can communicate hate or love</li>
                </ul>
