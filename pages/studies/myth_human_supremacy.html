                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Human Supremacism</h4>
                <p>Unquestioned beliefs are the real authorities of any culture. <strong>A central unquestioned belief of this culture is that humans are superior to and separate to everyone else</strong>. Human supremacism is part of the foundation of much of this culture's religion, science, economics, philosophy, art, epistemology, and so on.</p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">The Great Chain of Being</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">It's a <strong>hierarchy of perfection</strong>, with God at the top, then angels, then kings, then priests, then men, then women, then mammals, then birds, and so on, through plants, rocks and sand</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">It's a <strong>profoundly body-hating notion</strong> since those at the top (the perfect) are pure spirit, and those at the bottom (the imperfect, the corrupt) are pure matter, pure body</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>Humans are the center of attention</strong></li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>Those at the top get to use those below as they want</strong>. For example, men have access to the bodies of women, because men are higher on the hierarchy than women</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">The Great Chain of Being also underlies <strong>the modern belief that the world consists of resources to be exploited by humans</strong></li>
                </ul>
                <p>The Great Chain of Being has long been used to rationalize whatever hierarchies those in power wish to rationalize. It has been and is central to the notion of Divine Right of Kings, to racism, to patriarchy, to empire.</p>
                <p>The first line of defense of The Great Chain of Being was <em>religion</em>. Then, it was <em>science</em>. <strong>With science, Perfect and Abstract Reason (scientific law, abstract economics) substituted a Perfect and Abstract Distant Sky God</strong>.</p>
                <p>Most of scientific (and "common sense") arguments used to defend human supremacism are tautological: <strong>humans choose human characteristics as the measure of what characteristics define superiority</strong>. Because we think humans think with our brains, we humans have decided that brains and central nervous system are the only way that anyone can think and are therefore necessary for cognition.</p>
                <p>The fundamental assumption of supremacists is that until proven otherwise (and in fact, much longer) supremacists presume the other is not a subjective being.</p>
                <p>To not be able to conceptualize or accept the existence of any form of intelligence that doesn't resemble your own doesn't seem to me very intelligent. And to not be able to conceptualize or accept the existence of any form of suffering that doesn't resemble your own doesn't seem to me very compassionate or empathetic.</p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">The Great Chain of Being</h4>
                <p>When a supremacism of any sort is one of the unquestioned beliefs acting as a real authority of that culture, defenders of that supremacism nearly always perceive any questioning of any part of that supremacism as a "foolish distraction". They generally perceive and portray themselves as defenders of reasonableness and sanity, and perceive those questioning their supremacism as having come from the "nuthouse".</p>
                <p><strong>Because their supremacist perspective is unquestioned, all questioning of that supremacism by definition will be classed as speculation, and all speculation on that subject will be discouraged.</strong></p>
                <p>However, <strong>speculating about ways to escalate the ability of one's superior class to exploit all inferior classes is seen</strong> as innovation, creativity, and <strong>a sign of one's intelligence and superiority</strong></p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Purpose for Humans Only</h4>
                <p>Enlightenment and its applied twin the Industrial Revolution have combined to become a possibly fatal disaster for life on earth.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Enlightenment has destroyed our perception of the world as full of life and meaning and purpose</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">The Industrial Revolution has used the tools of Enlightenment to accomplish this destruction in the real, physical world. The former provides the philosophical foundation and methods of the latter</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>In this culture, only human-created function counts as true function, which means that only consciously-created function counts as true function. Since our bodies aren't considered "human", but only animal matter, our minds are what's important.</strong> We forget that the natural world is full of intelligence, and knows far better than we do what it's doing.</p>
                <p>How you perceive the world affects how you behave in the world. If you perceive only human constructs as having meaning or function, then you will overvalue human constructs. And if you perceive nonhumans and their creations as not having meaning or function, then you will undervalue nonhumans and their creations.</p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Anthropomorphizing</h4>
                <p>When it came to research on plant sentience, one of the main objections from the science community was that the researchers were anthropomorphizing the plants. The word means "to ascribe human characteristics to an animal, inanimate object, force of nature, etc".</p>
                <p><strong>This presumes a human ownership of intelligence, the ability to communicate, the ability to suffer, the ability to feel emotions, and so on. Any perception of these among nonhumans is to be eradicated. Never mind that these are all natural attributes.</strong></p>
                <p>The Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution are based on seeing the world as a giant machine, and nonhumans as "beast machines", as Descartes put it. Modern scientific discourse is based on machine language. But machines are a uniquely human-made project.</p>
                <p><strong>You can't get more anthropomorphic than to describe the world in mechanistic terms, to project a human construct onto the real, living world.</strong></p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Suckers and Cheats</h4>
                <p>One of the problems with science is that it allows exploiters to pretend they're describing reality when they're speculating and projecting. <strong>Part of the point of any exploitative philosophy is to make the explotation seem natural or inevitable.</strong></p>
                <p>It's pleasing for those who wish to exploit others to create a Great Chain of Being and to place themselves at its earthly top. It's pleasing for those who wish to "exploit natural resources" to create a philosophy, a worldview, an ideology, and a theology which declares the world consists of "natural resources", not other beings, and to clasify evidence to the contrary as "speculation" or "philosophizing" or "anthropomorphizing".</p>
                <div class="highlight">
                  <p>Science is a far better means of social control than Christianity. If you question Christianity you're merely consigned to a hell you don't believe in, but if you question science you must be just plain stupid.</p>
                </div>
                <p>If a primary argument for selfishness is that a world filled with givers would collapse when a cheat arrived, and the dominant culture is clearly a cheat who has arrived and is causing the world to collapse, wouldn't that in fact be an argument that prior to the arrival of the cheat the world might have been full of givers?</p>
                <p>The fact that members of this culture have through cheating gained a competitive advantage over other humans and nonhuman beings in no way implies any form of greater intelligence or any other form of superiority. <strong>Cheating gains a competitive advantage at the cost of future extinction of those from whom the cheater is taking, and then also the cheater themselves</strong>.</p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Value-Free Science</h4>
                <p><strong>One of the myths of modern culture is that science is value free, which is not true.</strong></p>
                <p>Science is supposed to be "disintered", we always hear. If it's not "disinterested" then it's not science. However, the practice of science in the 21st century is becoming shaped less by national priorities or by peer-review groups and more by the particular preferences of individuals with huge amounts of money.</p>
                <p><strong>Industry, industrialist and the military-industrial complex have driven science from the beginning. It's only because we want to forget all this that we pretend science is disinterested in the first place.</strong></p>
                <p>Research that in some way or another attempts to extend human control over the universe is considered value free. Attempts by humans to control the universe are in our very definition of how we know something is true.</p>
                <p><strong>But extending human control over the universe is a value</strong>. And it's a value that materially benefits (in the short term, so long as you don't mind a murdered planet) the humans doing the research, and those funding the research, and those publishing the research, and those using the technologies that emerge from the research. They're not and can never be "disinterested".</p>
                <p><strong>Our self-perceived superiority is based on our ability to enslave or destroy others.</strong></p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Authoritarian Technics</h4>
                <p>Technologies don't exist in a vacuum. Technologies emerge from and then give rise to certain social forms. Technics can be democratic or authoritarian.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Does the technology require a large-scale hierarchical structure? Does it reinforce this structure?</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Does it lend itself to the monopolization of the technology, and therefore to control of those who fabricate the technology over those who use it?</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Is this technology something that anyone can make? Or is it a technology that requires massive hierarchical (and distant) organizations?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>When authoritarian, unsustainable, human supremacist cultures encounter cultures which are none of these, they quite often conquer or destroy them. This is not only because unsustainable cultures must expand or collapse, but also because supremacist cultures by definition disrespect difference.</p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Agriculture</h4>
                <p><strong>Controlling food supply is of course central to authoritarian regimes</strong>. The more necessary some product is, the more that control of the product by authorities leads to control of those who need the product.</p>
                <p>When a culture destroys its own landbase (through agriculture, urbanization or any other means), it then has 2 choices: collapse or take someone else's landbase.</p>
                <p>Since cultures rarely choose to collpase, this means once a culture has committed itself to an agricultural way of life (which, by definition, destroys landbases) it's committed to expansion, and since someone else already lives there, to conquest. This means the culture must be militarized, both internally and externally.</p>
                <p><strong>What agriculture did was allow human population to increase, by converting the entire biome to human use. It also lead to increased militarization, increased authoritarianism, and increase in rape culture, the destruction of the biosphere and so on. It's an authoritarian technic, and has lead to ever increasing centralized control of food supplies.</strong></p>
                <div class="highlight">
                  <p>Controlling people's food supply controls them. None of this is the same as being a solution to food scarcity.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Prior to the plow, the world was already full of food. It just wasn't under human control, or more precisely the control of an elite. It was available to humans and nonhumans, without regard to any individual or collective human wealth.</p>
                <p>This means that within this culture that is based on authoritarian technics, not only won't these wild foods surpluses be considered real (the only real food surplus is one humans create and control) but worse, that these other communities that provide these food surpluses must be eradicated in order to maintain control of human populations.</p>
                <p><strong>How are you going to force people to work for you if they can find food, clothing, and shelter on their own?</strong></p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">The Technics in Charge</h4>
                <p>The logic behind the technologies can come to rule. The technics, and not the people or the landbase, are in control. <strong>Actions are taken to protect and further the technics, not living beings</strong>.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Corporations are legal tools to facilitate commerce. When corporations (legal fictions) control social decision making processes, the tools are literally in charge</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Money is a legal tool to facilitate exchange. But when social decisions are made not primarily because they serve humans and nonhumans, but rather because they "make money", then money is obviously controlling the decision-making process</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">When social decisions are made not primarily because they serve life, but because they increase the power of the decision-makers and others of their class, then power itself and not life is the real authority behind the decisions</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Within this supremacist culture our epistemology (how we know whether something is true) is tied to domination</strong>. This tie between domination and epistemology is generally accepted without question or thought in this culture. Likewise, within this supremacist culture it's authoritarian technics that are generally considered the greatest achievements.</p>
                <p><strong>The Divine Right of Kings has not been abandoned. It has morphed into the Divine Right of Humans, especially the Divine Right of Industrial ("Developed") Humans. Even worse, it has morphed into the Divine Right of Machines.</strong></p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Intelligence as a Lethal Mutation</h4>
                <p>How can we stop the murder of the planet if leading intellectuals label intelligence itself as "lethal", and say that the murder of the planet is a result of this intelligence?</p>
                <p>We've all been taught that life is somehow like a computer game, where your success is measured by how many points you get; or like <em>Risk</em>, where your success is measured by how many plastic armies you have and how much of the map you control. <strong>This measure of biological success is simply the same old Biblical commandment to go forth and multiply projected onto the natural world</strong>.</p>
                <p><strong>It's also a projection of the dominant economic mindset onto the natural world</strong>, a capitalist mindset where your sucess is measured by how many dollars or how many franchises you own.</p>
                <p>A better measure of biological success would be whether the presence and population of a given species improves the health and resilience of the larger biotic community of whom it's a member and on whom it relies for sustenance, thereby ensuring its own species' survival as well as the survival of other members of its biotic community.</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Labeling intelligence as lethal also naturalizes destructiveness</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">It also transforms the murder of the planet from an ongoing result of lots of very bad and very immoral ongoing social choices into something beyond our control, into something we can't do anything about, into a classic tragedy with us starring as the tragic hero whose tragic flaw is that they are just too damn smart for this world</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>What if the primary form of intelligence we recognize, we reward, we encourage, we worship, what if that form of intelligence is lethal?</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Humans as Creators of Nature</h4>
                <p>In order to make their food species easier to control, agriculturalists reduce or eliminate the natural defenses of the target species. This is done selectively breeding docile plants that focus on making themselves more nutritious instead of making themselves toxic. In animals it's done selectively breeding docile animals who are more likely to put on meat than fight or run.</p>
                <p><strong>Because we have formed or deformed these other beings (plants, animals and others) to suit our needs, we can come to believe that <em>we</em> and not the planet are their creators</strong>. This then causes too many of us to believe we can (and should) make the entire world do what we want.</p>
                <p>Since the natural world is always trying to reclaim (heal) the land you've converted solely to human use, it can be very easy to start to believe that the source of the necessities of your life is your own creations, and that nature is not only <em>not</em> the source of the necessities of your life but rather the <em>enemy</em> of all that is the source of the necessities of your life, the enemy of your creations, the enemy of you. <strong>This can lead to a perception of the necessity of a perpetual war against nature.</strong></p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">The Sociopocene</h4>
                <p>It's like the Catholics say, Nulla salus extra ecclesium, which means "Outside the Church there is no salvation. Likewise, this culture believes:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Outside Science there is no knowledge</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Outside Technology there is no comfort</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Outside Capitalism there are no economic transactions</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Outside Industrial Civilization there is no humanity</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Outside civilized humans there is no intelligence</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Outside humans there is no function, no purpose, no meaning</li>
                  <li class="summary__list-item">Outside humans there is no meaningful existence</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Since the extinction rate of species is ocurring 1.000 times faster than species naturally go exinct, now we're at a place of actively having to decide which species to save and which ones to let go.</p>
                <p>This is precisely where this culture has been headed from the beginning: <strong>it always wanted to play God and decide who lives and who dies. That's the central point of supremacism. How do we know we're superior? Because we're the ones deciding.</strong></p>
                <p>Nature doesn't exist, and insofar as it does, we will destroy it. This is the point of human supremacism management. This is why we can't acknowledge that human supremacist management always fails: <strong>because it doesn't, it achieves what it set out to achieve: the destruction of the biosphere.</strong></p>
                <div class="highlight">
                  <p>The technotopian vision is just a secular version of the same monotheistic conceit that life on Earth is a vale of tears and the real glory is in heaven. It doesn't much matter whether you believe the only meaning comes from a God who looks like an old man with a beard, or the only meaning comes from things created by man, you're still saying that the earth is meaningless. You're still showing contempt and hatred for the earth.</p>
                  <p>It doesn't matter whether you believe heaven is way up in the star where God lives, or whether you believe heaven is way up in the stars where you want your ships to go, you still don't believe that the earth is a good place to be.</p>

                <h4 class="keypoints__subtitle">Rebooting the World</h4>
                <p><strong>There is no Great Chain of Being or "food chain". It's all cycles within cycles. It doesn't matter whether you are an elephant or a worm, you eat and you will be eaten. That's life.</strong></p>
                <p>The biggest difference between Western and Indigenous worldviews is that Indigenous humans generally perceive the world as consisting of other beings with whom they can and should enter into a respectful relationship, and Westerners generally perceive the world as consisting of resources to be exploited.</p>
                <p>There is a cause-and-effect relationship between not <em>stopping</em> destructive activities, and not <em>stopping</em> the destruction those destructive activities cause. <strong>So many people want the destruction to cease, but don't want to stop the destructive activities. And this is the main point of geoengineering.</strong></p>
                <p><strong>The point from the beginning has been to destroy the wild nature human supremacists fear and hate, and replace it with what they can attempt to control.</strong></p>
                <p>The most important thing to remember is that the world is more complex than we're capable of thinking, and more interrelated than we're capable of thinking, and actions will inevitably have far more consequences than the original actors are capable of conceptualizing, much less predicting.</p>
