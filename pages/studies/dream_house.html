                  <p>If you are assuming there are two bedrooms, you are both right and wrong. Who is to say that there are only two bedrooms? Every room can be a bedroom: you only need a bed, or not even that. You only need to sleep there. <em>The inhabitant gives the room its purpose. Your actions are mightier than any architect's intentions</em>.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>(...) even as children, we understand something we cannot articulate: The diagnosis never changes. We will always be hungry, will always want. Our bodies and minds will always crave something, even if we don't recognize it.</p>
                    <p>If you could harness that energy (that constant, roving hunger) you could do wonders with it. You could push the earth inch by inch through the cosmos until it collided heart-first with the sun.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Your female crushes were always floating past you, out of reach, but she touches your arm and looks directly at you and you feel like a child buying something with her own money for the first time.</p>
                  <p>Anyway, those boys. You were suspicious of their feelings because you had no reason to love yourself (not your body, not your mind). You rejected so much gentleness. What were you looking for?</p>
                  <p>There is a Quichua riddle: <em>El que me nombre, me rompe</em>. Whatever names me, breaks me. The solution, of course, is "silence". But the truth is, anyone who knows your name can break you in two.</p>

                    <p>He doesn't lock her in her room or in the house. He doesn't have to. He turns her mind into a prision.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>A reminder, perhaps, that abusers do not need to be, and rarely are, cackling maniacs. They just need to want something, and not care how they get it.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Even when sex between women was, in its own way, acknowledged, it functioned as a kind of unmooring from gender. A lesbian acted like a man but was, still, a woman; and yet she had forfeited some essential femininity.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>"By elevating physical violence over the other facets of a battered woman's experience," law professor Leigh Goodmark wrote in 2004, "the legal system sets the standard by which the stories of battered women are judged. If there is no [legally designated] assault, she is not a victim, regardless of how debilitating her experience has been, how complete her isolation, or how horrific the emotional abutse she has suffered. And by creating this kind of myopia about the nature of domestic violence, the legal system does battered women a grave injustice."</p>
                  <p>In the pit of it, you fantasize about dying. Tripping on a sidewalk and stumbling into the path of an oncoming car. A gas leak silently offing you in your sleep. A machete-wielding madman on public transit. Falling down the stairs, but drunk, so you flop limb over limb like a marionette and feel no pain. Anything to make it stop. <strong>You have forgotten than leaving is an option</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Queer folks fail each other too. This seems like an obvious thing to say; it is not, for example, a surprise to nonwhite queers or trans queers that intracommunity loyalty goes only so far, especially when it must confront the hegemony of the state.</p>
                  <p><strong>Women could abuse other women. Women <em>have</em> abused other women. And queers need to take this issue seriously, because no one else would.</strong></p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>We think of clichés as boring and predictable, but they are actually one of the most dangerous things in the world. Your brain can't engage a cliché, not properly, it skitters right over the phrase or sentence or idea without a second thought.</p>

                <div class="subsection my-5">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Queer Representation</h3>
                  <p>This concept (also called <em>archival silence</em>) illustrates a difficult truth: sometimes stories are destroyed, and sometimes they are never uttered in the first place; either way something very large is irrevocably missing from our collective histories.</p>
                  <p><strong>What is placed in or left out of the archive is a political act, dictated by the archivist and the political context in which she lives.</strong></p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>And yet, while I recognize the problem intellectually (the system of coding, the way villainy and queerness became a kind of shorthand for each other) I cannot help but love these fictional queer villains. I love them for all of their aesthetic lushness and theatrical glee, their fabulousness, their ruthlessness, their <em>power</em>. They're always by far the most interesting characters on the screen. After all, they live in a world that hates them. They've adapted; they've learned to conceal themselves. They've survived.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>There is a question of representation tied up in the anguish around the queer villain; <strong>when so few gay characters appear on-screen, their disproportionate villainy is (obviously) suspect. </strong>It tells a single story, to paraphrase Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, and <strong>creates real-life associations of evil and depravity</strong>. It is not incorrect to tell an artist that there is responsibility tangled up in whom you choose to make villains, but it is also not a simple matter.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>(...) by expanding representation, we give space to queers to be (as characters, as real people) human beings. They don't have to be metaphors for wickedness and depravity or icons of conformity and docility. They can be <em>what they are</em>. <strong>We deserve to have our wrongdoing represented as much as our heroism, because when we refuse wrongdoing as a possibility for a group of people, we refuse their humanity.</strong> That is to sy, queers (real-life ones) do not deserve representation, protection, and rights because they are morally pure or upright as a people. <strong>They deserve those things because they are human beings, and that is enough.</strong></p>
                  </div>
                  <p><em>We can't stop living.</em> Which means <em>we have to live</em>, which means <em>we are alive</em>, which means <em>we are humans and we are human</em>: some of us are unkind and some of us are confused and some of sleep with the wrong people and some of us make bad decisions and some of us are murderers. And it sounds terrible but it is, in fact, freeing: <strong>the idea that <em>queer</em> does not equal good our pure or right</strong>. It is simply a state of being(one subject to politics, to its own social forces, to larger narratives, to moral complexities of every kind. So bring on the queer villains, the queer heroes, the queer sidekicks and secondary characters and protagonists and extras. They can be a complete cast unto themselves. Let them have agency, and then let them go.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection my-5">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Dream House as Public Relations</h3>
                  <p>But that's the minority anxiety, right? That if you're not careful, someone will see you (or people who share your identity) doing something human and use it against you.</p>
                  <p><strong>It's not being radical to point out that people on the fringe have to be better than people in the mainstream, that they have twice as much to prove.</strong> In trying to get people to see your humanity, you reveal just that: your humanity. Your fundamentally problematic nature. All the unique and terrible ways in which people can, and do, fail.</p>
                  <p>You can be hurt by people who look just like you. Not only can it happen, it probably will, because the world is full of hurt people who hurt people. Even if the dominant culture considers you and anomaly, that doesn't mean you can't be common, common as fucking dirt.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection my-5">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Dream House as Bluebeard</h3>
                  <p>Bluebeard's greatest lie was that there was only one rule: the newest wife could do anything she wanted (anything) as long as she didn't do that (single, arbitrary) thing; didn't stick that tiny, inconsequential key into that tiny, inconsequential lock.</p>
                  <p>But we all know that was just the beginning, a test. She failed (and lived to tell the tale, as I have), but even if she'd passed, even if she'd listened, there would have been some other request, a little larger, a little stranger, and if she'd kept going (<strong>kept allowing herself to be trained, like a corset fanatic pinching her waist smaller and smaller</strong>) there'd have been a scene where Bluebeard danced around with the rotting corpses of his past wives clasped in his arms, and the newest wife would have sat there mutely, suppressing growing horror, swallowing the egg of vomit that bobbed behind her breastbone. And then later, another scene, in which he did unspeakable things to the bodies (women, they'd once been women) and she just stared dead into the middle distance, seeking some mute purgatory where she could live forever.</p>

                </div>

                <div class="subsection my-5">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Dream House as American Gothic</h3>
                  <p>A narrative needs two things to be a gothic romance. The first, <strong>"woman plus habitation."</strong> The house is not essential for domestic abuse, but hell, it helps: a private space where private dramas are enacted behind, as the cliché goes, closed doors; but also windows sealed against the sound, drawn curtains, silent phones.</p>
                  <p>The second necessary element: <strong>"marrying a stranger."</strong> Strangers, feminist film theorist Diane Waldman points out, because during the 1940s (the heyday of gothic romance films like <em>Rebecca</em> and <em>Dragonwyck</em> and <em>Suspicion</em>) men were returning from war, no longer familiar to the people they'd left behind.</p>
                  <p><strong>"The Gothic heroine", film scholar Tania Modleski says, "tries to convince herself that her suspicions are unfounded, that, since she loves him, he must be trustworthy and that she will have failed as a woman if she does not implicitly believe in him."</strong></p>
                  <p>There is, of course, a major problem with the gothic: it is by nature hetero-normative.</p>
                  <p>We were not married; she was not a dark and brooding man. It was hardly a crumbling ancestral manor; just a single-family home, built at the beginning of the Great Deprssion. No moors, just a golf course. But it was "woman plus habitation," and she was a stranger.</p>
                  <p>She was a stranger because something essential was shielded, releasedm in tiny bursts until it became a flood, a flood of what I realized I did not know. <strong>Afterward, I would mourn her as if she'd died, because something had: someone we had created together</strong>.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection my-5">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Dream House as Inner Sanctum</h3>
                  <p>I often think about how special it is for children to have their own rooms; <strong>the necessary sacredness of private space(of the body, of the mind)</strong>.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>I had a room to myself as a kid, but my mother was always quick to point out that it wasn't <em>my room</em>, it was <em>her room</em> and I was merely permitted to occupy it. Her point, of course, was that my parents had earned everything and I was merely borrowing the space, and while this is technically true I cannot help but marvel at the singular damage of this dark idea: <strong>That my existence as a child was a kind of debt and nothing, no matter how small, was mine. That no space was truly private; anything of mine could be forfeited at someone else's whim.</strong></p>
                  </div> 
                </div>

                <div class="subsection my-5">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Dream House as Fantasy</h3>
                  <p>Fantasy is, I think, the defining cliché of female queerness. No wonder we joke about U-Hauls on the second date. To find desire, love, everyday joy without men's accompanying bullshit is a pretty decent working definition of paradise.</p>
                  <p>Maybe this will change someday. <strong>Maybe, when queerness is so normal and accepted that finding it will feel less like entering paradise and more like the claiming of your own body: imperfect, but yours.</strong></p>
