                  <h4 class="summary__title--subtitle-secondary">What is "life"?</h4>
                  <p>"All life forms are composed of molecules that are not themselves alive." At what level of organization does life "kick in"? In what ways do living and nonliving matter differ?</p>
                  <h4 class="summary__title--subtitle-secondary">What does life do?</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><em>Life metabolizes</em>. All organisms process chemicals and, in doing so, bring energy to their bodies.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><em>Life has complexity and organization</em>. All life is composed of a great number of atoms arraged in intricate ways. But complexity is not enough, it's organization of this complexity that is a hallmark of life.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><em>Life reproduces</em>. Life must not only make a copy of itself, but also make a copy of the mechanism taht allows further copying. </li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><em>Life develops</em>. Once a copy is made, life continues to change, to develop.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><em>Life is autonomous</em>. An organism is autonomous, or has self-determination. This autonomy again separates life from machine.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><em>Life evolves</em>. This is one of the most fundamental properties of life. The paradox of permanence and change: genes must replicate, and if they can't do it with regularity, the organism will die. Yet, if replication is perfect, there's no variability, no way that evolution through natural selection can take place. <strong>Evolution is the key to adaptation, and without adaptation there can be no life</strong>. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <h4 class="summary__title--subtitle-secondary">Carl Sagan's definition of life:</h4>
                  <p>Life as a chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution. Meaning that there are more individuals present in the environment than there is energy available, so some will die. Those who survive do so because they can carry advantageous heritable traits that they pass on to their descendants, giving the offspring greater ability to survive. </p>
                  <h4 class="summary__title--subtitle-secondary">Basic concepts of Darwinian Evolution:</h4>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">All life on Earth came from a <strong>single common ancestor</strong></li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Life reproduces to produce slightly different versions of the parent. Most "parents" produce more offspring than can live because of shortages of food, shelter or other necessities. Because of this, some will die. <strong>Those that survived in the long run was because they had characteristics that made them in some way superior to others of their own species</strong>. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Darwin saw this competition as "survival of the fittest" and gave the process the name of "natural selection". </p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Defining Earth Life</h3>
                  <p>While some worry about the biodiversity point out how the Earth is losing species, the reality is that there is only one kind of life on Earth: <strong>our familiar DNA/RNA life</strong>.</p>
                  <p><strong>DNA is the information storage system of life itself, the "software" that runs all of Earth life's software. </strong></p>
                  <p>Earth life uses 20 amino acids. Not 19. Not 21. And it's always the same 20! DNA codes for RNA, which codes for protein, which are all made up of combinations of the 20 amino acids. This is a central characteristic of Earth life. </p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>One of the most compelling observations supporting the notion that all life on Earth is descended from a common ancestor is the planetwide use of the same 20 amino acids as the components of proteins.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Having DNA is obviously not all there is to life. We need a wall (membrane) to enclose our cell, and a solvent to fill it with. <strong>Both the wall or membrane structure and the solvent are also features that we can use to identify common Earth life</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Biochemist Steven Benner suggests that a requirement of life is some sort of scaffolding, for the building blocks of our life structure and to hold biomolecules in correct orientation as to allow chemical processes of life. <strong>Our Earth life uses carbon as the scaffolding element, but silicon could be used as well</strong>. </p>
                  <p>Life seems to be composed of 3 separate sets of "machines":</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">one for extracting energy from the environment,</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">one for building and maintaining the physical body, </li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">and one for maintaining (and replicating) the information and blueprints for all 3 "machines"</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Evolution takes place because of actions by the information system. It's the very complexity of life that leads to the mistakes (mutations), few mistakes that over the long roll of time of the life of a species are sufficient to continuously reshuffle the deck of genes of any species. </p>
                  <p>Based on all we've detailed above, we can say that <strong>all known Earth life is Darwinian</strong>.</p>
