                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>What makes for "successful" life? Perhaps we can say that being alive is success. But clearly this is too limiting. Rephrasing the question, what is success in a biological context?</p>
                  <p>Some criteria that we could define are:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__link-item">Individual (lifespan) longevity.</li>
                    <li class="summary__link-item">Species longevity. It's important to note that there doesn't seem to be a correlation between individual and species longevity. There are species that are more "extinction-proof" than others, so we could use a low extinction rate as a measure of success.</li>
                    <li class="summary__link-item">Species "fecundity". This means the number of new species a particular species produced. Species don't smoothly change from one to another, they give rise to new species and exist alongside them. The species that produced the most new species had short longevities in time, while long-lived species produced very few new species. </li>
                    <li class="summary__link-item">Individual abundance. Meaning, how common is a particular species, for example, fruit flies, dandelions or certain kind of microbes.</li>
                    <li class="summary__link-item">Percentage of the planet's biomass (the mass of living organisms, including animals, plants and microorganisms). Success measured not in the number of individuals of a species, but the proportion of the total biomass on Earth an individual species makes up. Microbes would certainly win this category. </li>
                    <li class="summary__link-item">Species that co-opt other species for their betterment. Humans are the obvious example, but termites and ants also do this. </li>
                    <li class="summary__link-item">Wide geographic range.</li>
                    <li class="summary__link-item">Surviving mass extinctions.</li>
                    <li class="summary__link-item">The ability to move to other planets as Earth becomes uninhabitable, or to keep the Earth habitable beyond its natural lifetime. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Considering these criteria, the ideal individual would be immortal and would belong to a species that is extinction-proof, is widespread, has the highest relative and absolute biomass of the planet, and has the capability to either terraform our planet as it becomes "unterran" or migrate to a new planet. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">A Model for a Successful Biosphere</h3>
                  <p>What would constitute a "successful" biosphere? It seems that the properties of populations and ecosystems are different from the properties of individuals. Some criteria to consider are: </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Diversity of species on Earth. </li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Biomass on Earth.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Stability of the species assemblage on Earth.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Minimal risk of the end of life on the planet through some means.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Today we live in a very diverse world. However, the greatest diversity should have existed in the Eocene, when the planet was a global jungle and had nearly global tropics. Models by a group at Potsdam show maximal biomass nearly a billion years ago, with a current downward trend.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p><strong>Could it be that the production of ever more species actually reduces the biomass on a planet?</strong> Perhaps we have traded a world of a few, long-lived species for one with many, "more successful" species that produce many daughter species of themselves but at the same time have a very high extinction rate. This would be a very Medean relationship. </p>
