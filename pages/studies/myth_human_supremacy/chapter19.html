                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>According to Elon Musk, "Humans have yet to undertake an exhaustive, or even vigorous, search for extraterrestial intelligence, of course. But we have gone a great deal further than a casual glance skyward. For more than 50 years, we have trained radio telescopes on nearby stars, hoping to detect an electromagnetic signal, a beacon beamed across the abyss. We have searched for sentry probes in our solar system, and we have examined local stars for evidence of alien engineering. Soon, we will begin looking for synthetic pollutants in the atmospheres of distant planets, and asteroid belts with missing metals, which might suggest mining activity."</p>
                  <p>And there we have it: <strong>a sure sign of intelligence is pollution. And other is mining, which is the second most destructive human activity after agriculture.</strong> </p>
                  <p>I guess the Indigenous humans who didn't produce air pollution and who didn't  mine must not have been intelligent. Just as the nonhumans who don't produce air pollution and who don't mine must not be intelligent.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>When scientist search for signs of intelligent extraterrestrial life, they're actually searching for signs of authoritarian technics. <strong>But authoritarian technics is not the same as intelligence.</strong></p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Intelligence is defined as creating civilizations and starships. Left unsaid is the process of murdering the planet that inheres in civilizations. But the point remains: <strong>intelligence is here defined in action as theft from landbases for use by the "intelligent".</strong> But that's not intelligence. That's just theft. And when that theft harms the planet that keeps you alive, that's really stupid.</p>
                  <p>Ernst Mayr's comment about intelligence being a lethal mutation could be true if we changed it to: <strong>Authoritarian technics are lethal social constructs.</strong></p>
                  <p>It's extraordinary that people who say that evolution is based on random mutations can at the same time say that we are the pinnacle of evolution. <strong>If the mutations are random, there is no pinnacle. If the mutations are random, there is no inevitable endpoint.</strong></p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>The technotopian vision is just a secular version of the same monotheistic conceit that life on Earth is a vale of tears and the real glory is in heaven. It doesn't much matter whether you believe the only meaning comes from a God who looks like an old man with a beard, or the only meaning comes from things created by man, <strong>you're still saying that the earth is meaningless. You're still showing contempt and hatred for the earth.</strong></p>
                    <p>It doesn't matter whether you believe heaven is way up in the star where God lives, or whether you believe heaven is way up in the stars where you want your ships to go, <strong>you still don't believe that the earth is a good place to be.</strong></p>
                  </div>
                  <p>There are some differences though. One is that at least God was more powerful than Man. Now, though, we've gotten rid of that silly God talk and it is <em>we</em> who are on the path to becoming godlike in our capabilities.</p>
