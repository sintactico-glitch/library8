                    <p>The Divine Right of Kings has not been abandoned. It has morphed into the Divine Right of Humans, especially the Divine Right of Industrial ("Developed") Humans. Even worse, it has morphed into the Divine Right of Machines.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>At the very moment Western nations threw off the ancient regime of absolute government, operating under a once-divine king, <strong>they were restoring this same system in a far more effective form in their technology</strong>, reintroducing coercions of a military character no less strict in the organization of a factory than in the new uniformed and regimented army.</p>
                  <p>With the knitting together of a scientific ideology, authoritarian technics found an instrument at hand that has now given it absolute command of physical energies of cosmic dimensions. The inventors of nuclear bombs, space rockets, and computers are the pyramid builders of our own age: psychologically inflated by a similar myth of unqualified power, moved by obsessions and compulsions no less irrational than those of earlier absolute systems: <strong>particularly the notion that the system itself must be expanded, at whatever eventual cost to life</strong>.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                      <p>"Ernst Mayr basically argued that <strong>intelligence is a kind of lethal mutation</strong>. And he had a good argument. He pointed out that if you take a look at <strong>biological success, which is essentially measured by how many of us are there</strong>, the organisms that do quite well are those that mutate very quickly, like bacteria, or those that are stuck in a fixed ecological niche, like beetles. But as you go up the scale of what we call intelligence, they are less and less successful. By the time you get to mammals, there are very few of them as compared with insects. By the time you get to humans, the origin of humans may be 100.000 years ago, there is a very small group. We are kind of misled now because there are a lot of humans around, but that's a matter of a few thousand years, which is meaningless from an evolutionary point of view. His argument was, you're just not going to find intelligent life elsewhere, and you probably won't find it here for very long either because it's just a lethal mutation. He also added, a little bit ominously, that the average life span of a species, of the billions that have existed, is about 100.000 years, which is roughly the length of time that modern humans have existed."</p>

                  <p><strong>How can we stop the murder of the planet if leading intellectuals label intelligence itself as "lethal", and say that the murder of the planet is a result of this intelligence?</strong></p>
                  <p>Another point is the definition of biological success. We've all been taught that life is somehow like a computer game, where your success is measured by how many points you get; or like <em>Risk</em>, where your success is measured by how many plastic armies you have and how much of the map you control. <strong>This measure of biological success is simply the same old Biblical commandment to go forth and multiply projected onto the natural world</strong>.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>It's also a projection of the dominant economic mindset onto the natural world, a capitalist mindset where your sucess is measured by how many dollars or how many franchises you own.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>A better measure of biological success would be whether the presence and population of a given species improves the health and resilience of the larger biotic community of whom it's a member and on whom it relies for sustenance, thereby ensuring its own species' survival as well as the survival of other members of its biotic community.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>Labeling intelligence as lethal also naturalizes destructiveness</strong>. Even when we do literally the stupidest thing possible (kill the planet that is our only home and supports our lives), it's a sign of our intelligence. We're so damn smart that we're maladaptive.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">It also <strong>fuels this already-supremely-narcissistic culture's narcissism</strong>. "Oh, we're killing the planet because we're so smart? How kind of you to say that"</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">It also <strong>transforms the murder of the planet from an ongoing result of lots of very bad and very immoral ongoing social choices</strong>, which we can name and which provide tangible benefits for some classes of people at the expense of others, <strong>into something beyond our control, into something we can't do anything about, into a classic tragedy with us starring as the tragic hero whose tragic flaw is that they are just too damn smart for this world</strong></li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">By calling the murder of the planet an act of intelligence, one is encouraging that destructiveness. Smart is good, right? We'd rather be smart than not smart, right?</li>

                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>What if the primary form of intelligence we <em>recognize</em>, we reward, we encourage, we worship, what if <em>that</em> form of intelligence is lethal?</p>
