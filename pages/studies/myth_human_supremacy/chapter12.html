                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>I find it extraordinary (and of course, entirely expected) that so many human supremacists happily speak of bending the entire world to "our" will, and attempt to force all of us to live with lees of the planet (and to force all those exterminated not to live at all), but then they freak out at the possibility of someone "commanding" them to live with fewer luxuries (luxuries that are gained by forcing others to bend to their will), and freak out as well at the possibility of reshaping this culture to be in line with the needs of the planet, the source of all life.</p>
                  <p>Prior to the plow, the world was already full of food. It just wasn't under human control, or more precisely the control of an elite. It was available to humans and nonhumans, without regard to any individual or collective human wealth.</p>
                  <p>This means that within this culture that is based on authoritarian technics, not only won't these wild foods surpluses be considered real (the only real food surplus is one humans create and control) but worse, <strong>that these other communities that provide these food surpluses must be eradicated in order to maintain control of human populations</strong>.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>How are you going to force people to work for you if they can find food, clothing, and shelter on their own?</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>You could argue that it doesn't matter how destructive and disastrous plows and agriculture have been to the entire planet. They helped human populations expand, they helped "push wolves, bears, tigers and other wild beasts out to the wild fringe places of the world." </p> 
                  <p><strong>Far from arguing that the destruction of wild places doesn't matter, the argument would be that this destruction is actually <em>the</em> sign of our intelligence and superiority</strong>.</p>
                  <p>You could also argue taht it's not the human invention of plows (and other weapons of mass destruction) as such that implies human supremacy, but instead it's the human <em>capacity</em> to invent plows that implies this supremacy.</p>
                  <p>The truth is we are really good at creating gadgets. It's perhaps our most obvious gift as a species. Does the capacity to invent gadgets really imply superiority, or even intelligence?</p>
                  <p>If this gadget-making somehow becomes so compulsive that the gadgets threaten your own survival and the survival of the planet, how can even the most serious proponents of gadget-making still presume that the capacity to create gadgets is a sign of intelligence or superiority? The best we can say is that it sounds like a serious problem to be solved. But honestly it sounds more like a terrible addiction.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Our self-perceived superiority is <em>based</em> on our ability to enslave or destroy others.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Those who are addicted to power and control receive tangible benefits for feeding their addictions. This is one reason perpetrators of domestic violence (and slavers, capitalists and exploiters in general) rarely change: their behavior is gaining them tangible benefits. Never mind that doing so harms their relationships: if they're addicted to power and control, making others jump through hoops on command is by definition more important to them than having loving mutual relationships.</p>
                  <p>The clich√© is that addicts don't usually change till they hit bottom. But those who are addicted to power and control are not the ones who hit bottom: <strong>it's their victims who hit bottom</strong>. These particular addicts won't change so long as there is any other option, and quite often, not even then.</p>
