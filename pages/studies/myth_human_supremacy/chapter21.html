                  <p>There is no Great Chain of Being or "food chain". It's all cycles within cycles. It doesn't matter whether you are an elephant or a worm, you eat and you will be eaten. That's life.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>The biggest difference between Western and Indigenous worldviews is that Indigenous humans generally perceive the world as consisting of other beings with whom they can and should enter into a respectful relationship, and Westerners generally perceive the world as consisting of resources to be exploited.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>The western civilized worldview is unsustainable. A belief in human superiority is not sustainable, which means it's terminally maladaptative, which means it's an <strong>evolutionary dead end</strong>.</p>

                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Rebooting the Planet</h3>
                  <p><strong>Our culture (not our species) is defined (limited and ended by) the tools we use.</strong></p>
                  <p>There's a cause-and-effect relationship between destructive activities and the destruction they cause. There is a cause-and-effect relationship between <em>not stopping</em> destructive activities, and <em>not stopping</em> the destruction those destructive activities cause. <strong>So many people want the destruction to cease, but don't want to stop the destructive activities. And this is the main point of geoengineering.</strong></p>
                  <p>"Rebooting" the planet has been precisely what this culture has been aiming for since the beginnings of human supremacism. The point from the beginning has been to "shut down" the natural world, to kill it, and then use our own technics to "restart" some facsimile of it.</p>
                  <p><strong>The point from the beginning has been to destroy the wild nature human supremacists fear and hate, and replace it with what they can attempt to control.</strong></p>

                    <p>The most important thing to remember is that the world is more complex than we're capable of thinking, and more interrelated than we're capable of thinking, and actions will inevitably have far more consequences than the original actors are capable of conceptualizing, much less predicting.</p>
