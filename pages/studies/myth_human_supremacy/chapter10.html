                <h2 class="summary__title--main">Authoritarian Technics</h2>


                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>Technologies don't exist in a vacuum. Technologies emerge from and then give rise to certain social forms. Technics can be democratic or authoritarian. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Does the technology require a large-scale hierarchical structure? Does it reinforce this structure?</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Does it lend itself to the monopolization of the technology, and therefore to control of those who fabricate the technology over those who use it?</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Is this technology something that anyone can make? Or is it a technology that requires massive hierarchical (and distant) organizations?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>We can ask all of these questions not just about technologies, but about all "problems" and "solutions". We can also say that unsustainable and sustainable societies may look at the same situation and see entirely different "problems" to which they will find different "solutions."</p>
                  <p>When authoritarian, unsustainable, human supremacist cultures encounter cultures which are none of these, they quite often conquer or destroy them. This is not only because unsustainable cultures must expand or collapse, but also because supremacist cultures by definition disrespect difference. But even when unsustainable cultures don't conquer or destroy those who are sustainable, they may find themselves harmed or infected. </p>
                  <p>The problem changes from "How do we keep warm?" to "How do we make money?" or "How do we gain trade goods?". </p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>We must never forget that technologies affect our societies, and we must never forget to ask ourselves how these technologies affect our societies. Societies interested in sustainability and self-reliance have always asked themselves how new technologies will affect their communities. To not do so is a fatal mistake.</p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Agriculture</h3>
                  <p>Controlling food supply is of course central to authoritarian regimes. The more necessary some product is, the more that control of the product by authorities leads to control of those who need the product. </p>
                  <p>"Agriculture is biotic cleansing: you take a piece of land, you clear every living being off it (down to the bacteria), and then you plant it to human use. The plow is a tool (THE tool) by which this is done."</p>
                  <p>If biotic cleansing and conversion of a prairie or forest to exclusively human use doesn't constitute the repression by one class of all other classes, I don't know what does. </p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>When a culture destroys its own landbase (through agriculture, urbanization or any other means), it then has 2 choices: collapse or take someone else's landbase. </p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Since cultures rarely choose to collpase, this means once a culture has committed itself to an agricultural way of life (which, by definition, destroys landbases) it's committed to expansion, and since someone else already lives there, to conquest. This means the culture must be militarized, both internally and externally. </p>
                  <p>If you base your way of life on the use of a plow, you have to accept the slavery, ecocide, militarization (which also means a high rape culture), and conquest that comes with it.</p>
                  <p>If you convert your landbase into war machines and into soldiers, you will have a short term competitive advantage in a war with people who don't. This doesn't make you superior, or smarter. It makes you a thief and a murderer, and it makes your way of living unsustainable.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>The point of a supremacist mindset is to facilitate (emotionally, intellectually, theologically, physically) the exploitation of others. If some invention serves that purpose, it's a great invention, and a sign of one's own superiority. </p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Agriculture is usually presented as the solution to food scarcity. Different studies have found that human stature, health and intelligence all decreased with the rise of agriculture. Diversity of diet decreased. Hunger increased.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>What agriculture did was allow human population to increase, by converting the entire biome to human use. It also lead to increased militarization, increased authoritarianism, and increase in rape culture, the destruction of the biosphere and so on. It's an authoritarian technic, and has lead to ever increasing centralized control of food supplies. </p>
                    <p>Controlling people's food supply controls them. None of this is the same as being a solution to food scarcity. </p>
                  </div>
                  <p>There are several solutions to the problem of food scarcity that nonhumans and non industrialized humans use:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">You can live through the summer, like many plants, and insects like grasshoppers</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Another approach is to sleep or doze through the winter, some bears, fish and plants use this approach </li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">You could also stay awake but eat less through the winter, several mammals, amphibians and birds do this. Humans do it too, the Algonquin people, for example</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Another approach is to follow the food. This is migratory birds do, also many human communities do it too. These migrations are also ways to experience different places while the feces left behind by the different species help feed the ground and contribute to the environment's growth</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">A final approach is to store food through the winter. This is part of the promise of agriculture</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Both nonhuman and human cultures have come up ith a near infinitude of "solutions" to the "problem" of food scarcity. It's nonsense to say non-Indigenous humans are superior because of our ability to solve problems. Also, these other solutions have the elegance of not destroying the landbases but rather improving them, which makes them a far superior solution. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">50 Greatest Breakthroughs Since the Wheel</h3>
                  <p>The Atlantic gathered a panel of scientists, engineers, historians and others to make a list of the technologies that have shaped modern life. Some of the technologies listed include:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list">The plow</li>
                    <li class="summary__list">Penicillin</li>
                    <li class="summary__list">Anesthesia</li>
                    <li class="summary__list">Oil drilling</li>
                    <li class="summary__list">Radio and TV (propaganda)</li>
                    <li class="summary__list">Nuclear fission</li>
                    <li class="summary__list">Gunpowder</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>Almost all the technologies listed had the effect of centralizing power. Each technology is useful from the perspective of those who are interested in increasing power at the expense of nonhuman and human communities.</strong> </p>
                  <p>When you begin to question human supremacism, the list of achievements begins to look much different than it did before. <strong>The list seems to be made by those who don't consider themselves to be part of the earth. Instead, these lists are compiled by those who are at war with the world itself, with life itself</strong>. Suddenly it makes sense that plows and gunpowder and atomic bombs are all included in a list of  the greatest innovations.</p>
