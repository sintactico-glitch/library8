                <h2 class="summary__title--main">Agriculture</h2>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>If the entire history of agriculture (6000 years of destroying every biome it has touched) doesn't constitute "reason to believe" that agriculture is inherently destructive, what would constitute as evidence?</p>
                  <p>The destruction of the habitat is not a by-product of agricutlture. <strong>It's the <em>point</em> of agriculture: to convert land specifically for human use, and then to impede succession (that is, to stop the land's attempts to heal itself).</strong> </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Removing groundcover, which is the function of the plow, is the equivalent of flaying the biome who is being converted is being converted to cropland</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Agriculture destroys water quality. Primarily because of agriculture, a 25% of the world's river no longer reach the ocean or sea. This dewatering destroys rivers, wetlands, seas and oceans who need these waters</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Do we really need to talk about the unsustainability of so-called pesticides, and the relative intelligence of putting poison on your own food, in fact covering the planet in poisons?</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In order to make their food species easier to control, agriculturalists reduce or eliminate the natural defenses of the target species. This is done selectively breeding docile plants that focus on making themselves more nutritious instead of making themselves toxic. In animals it's done selectively breeding docile animals who are more likely to put on meat than fight or run.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Because we have formed or deformed these other beings (plants, animals and others) to suit our needs, we can come to believe that <em>we</em> and not the planet are their creators.</p>
                    <p>This then causes too many of us to believe we can (and should) make the entire world do what we want.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Also, because these domesticated plants and animals are reliant upon us for their survival, and because keeping these scarred and domesticated landscapes scarred and domesticated requires we constantly fight to keep nature from reclaiming (meaning, healing) these lands, we can come to believe that our position is keepers of the entire planet.</p>
                  <p>This insane (and maybe a bit narcissistic) belief that the entire world is ours to "run" comes to be one of those assumptions we must never question.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Since the natural world is always trying to reclaim (heal) the land you've converted solely to human use, it can be very easy to <strong>start to believe that the source of the necessities of your life is your own creations</strong>, and that nature is not only <em>not</em> the source of the necessities of your life but rather the <em>enemy</em> of all that is the source of the necessities of your life, the enemy of your creations, the enemy of you.</p>
                    <p><strong>This can lead to a perception of the necessity of a perpetual war against nature</strong>.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Converting the entire landbase to human use is certainly stealing from the nonhumans who live there, it's stealing from the humans living with those nonhumans, and it's stealing from those who would have lived in the future.</p>
