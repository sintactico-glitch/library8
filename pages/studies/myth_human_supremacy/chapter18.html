                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>Members of this culture have started calling this era the <em>Anthropocene</em>, the Age of Man. The term itself is really harmful, primarily because it doesn't help us stop this culture from killing the planet. It's also misleading. Humans aren't "transforming" (killing) the planet. Civilized humans are. There's a difference. Plenty of human cultures have lived on the planet without destroying it.</p>
                  <p>The narcissism extends beyond disbelieving that other cultures exist. It extends to believing no one else on the planet fully subjectively exists. </p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>It's like the Catholics say, <em>Nulla salus extra ecclesium</em>, which means "Outside the Church there is no salvation. Likewise, this culture believes:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">Outside Science there is no knowledge</li>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">Outside Technology there is no comfort</li>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">Outside Capitalism there are no economic transactions</li>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">Outside Industrial Civilization there is no humanity</li>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">Outside civilized humans there is no intelligence</li>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">Outside humans there is no function, no purpose, no meaning</li>
                      <li class="summary__list-item">Outside humans there is no meaningful existence</li>
                    </ul>
                  </div>
                  <p>I also have problems naming an age after a mass murderer. Should we call the 20th century the Age of Hitler? The Age of Stalin? If we're going to name this age after this culture, we must be honest and call it The Age of the Sociopath. The <em>Sociopocene</em>.</p>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Building an Ark for the Anthropocene</h3>
                  <p>Since the extinction rate of species is ocurring 1.000 times faster than species naturally go exinct, now we're at a place of actively having to decide which species to save and which ones to let go. </p>
                  <p>What species do you save? The ones most at risk? Charismatic animals, like lions, bears or elephants? The ones most likely to survive? The species that hold the most value to us?</p>
                  <p><strong>This is precisely where this culture has been headed from the beginning: it always wanted to play God and decide who lives and who dies. That's the central point of supremacism. How do we know we're superior? Because we're the ones deciding.</strong></p>
                  <p>The discussion is which species we want to save but it's never questioned which technologies should be kept, since the use of those technologies is actively destroying the planet and all that live in it.</p>
                  <p>We gain the benefits of exploiting the Earth, and now we're pretending that we face this terrible dilemma as to which of our victims we're going to save (for now). But it's not really a dilemma. From a supremacist perspective, I'm not a murderer and thief. I'm a savior. I saved one of you from certain death (at my own hand, but still). And being this savior is more evidence of my superiority. A lesser being might have mindlessly killed you all.</p>
                  <p><strong>The murder of the planet is not some tragedy ordained by fate because we're too damn smart. It's the result of a series of exremely bad social choices.</strong></p>
                  <p>This culture seems to believe (completely anthropomorphically) that the world is like a machine or a chair. Some human artifact. Something where the whole is no more than the sum of the parts. You can take apart a chair and swap out some parts, then put the chair back together, and you still have a chair. <strong>But that's not how life works, whether we're talking about a human body or the body of a river or a prairie. The whole is more than the sum of the parts.</strong></p>
                  <p>Animals don't need arks. What they need is a living planet. What really needs to be protected are the larger bodies who are their homes, the oceans, the forests, the rivers, the lakes, the entire larger communities.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Nature doesn't exist, and insofar as it does, we will destroy it. This is the point of human supremacism management. This is why we can't acknowledge that human supremacist management always fails: <strong>because it doesn't, it achieves what it set out to achieve: the destruction of the biosphere.</strong></p>
