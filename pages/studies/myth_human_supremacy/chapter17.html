                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>Every supremacism is unique. Human supremacism isn't the same as male supremacism or white supremacism.</p>
                  <p>They do share characteristics. One of them is that <strong>the supremacists create the perception (and the mythology to promote that perception) that members of classes or groups other than their own are inferior</strong>. And one of the best ways to create and then validate the notion that you're superior to these others is by violating or exploiting them.</p>  
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Supremacism is always comparative, because we can't be superior by ourselves.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Supremacism is about classifying those who are immediately identifable as different (different sex, different color of skin, differente economic or social class, different species) as inferior to us, making up rationales (religious, scientific, economic or whatever we imagine) for our perceived superiority, and then victimizing these "inferior" others. <strong>This vicimization then validates our perception of these others as inferior, thereby reinforcing our own sense of superiority to them</strong>.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p><strong>Violation becomes not merely an action, but an identity</strong>: who we are and how we and society define who we are.</p>
                    <p>Each new violation then reaffirms our superiority, as through these repeated acts of violation we come to perceive each new violation as reinforcement not only of our superiority over this other we violated, <strong>but as simply the way things are</strong>.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Without this identification of others as inferior, without this violation, we are not. We are a void. And so we must fill this void, fill it with validations of our superiority, fill it with violations. By sufficient repetition of both the violations and the claims of superiority we hope to convince ourselves.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">The inescapable system</h3>
                  <p>Present day technics differs from that of the overtly brutal, half-baked authoritarian systems of the past in one highly favorable particular: it has accepted <strong>the basic principle of democracy</strong>, that every member of society should have a share in its goods. By progressively fulfillin this part of the democratic promise, our system has achieved a hold over the whole community that threatens to wipe out every other vestige of democracy.</p>
                  <p><strong>The bargain we are being asked to ratify takes the form of a magnificent bribe</strong>. The condition is that one must not ask for nothing that the system doesn't provide, but likewise agree to take everything offered, duly processed and fabricated, homogenized and equalized, in the precise quantities that the system, rather than the person, requires. </p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Once one opts for the system no further choice remains.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Once our authoritarian technics consolidates its powers, with the aid of its new forms of mass control, its abundance of tranquillizers and sedatives and aphrodisiacs, could democracy in any form survive? That question is absurd: <strong>life itself will not survive, except what is funneled through the mechanical collective</strong>.</p>
