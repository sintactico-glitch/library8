                <h2 class="summary__title--main">The Great Chain of Being</h2>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>One of the most harmful notions of Western Civilization is the Great Chain of Being  (or Latin <em>scala naturae</em> which literally means "ladder or stairway of nature").</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">It's a <strong>hierarchy of perfection</strong>, with God at the top, then angels, then kings, then priests, then men, then women, then mammals, then birds, and so on, through plants, rocks and sand</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">It's a <strong>profoundly body-hating</strong> notion since those at the top (the perfect) are pure spirit, and those at the bottom (the imperfect, the corrupt) are pure matter, pure body</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>Humans are the center of attention</strong>, with those above humans being bodiless and perfected, and those below being fully embodied, imperfect and having no mind </li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">And of course, <strong>those at the top get to use those below as they want</strong>. For example, men have access to the bodies of women, because men are higher on the hierarchy than women</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">The Great Chain of Being also underlies the modern belief that <strong>the world consists of resources to be exploited by humans</strong>. Traditional Indigenous people across the earth don't believe in this hierarchy: they believe the world consists of other beings with whom we should enter into respectful relationship, not inferior others to be exploited. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>The Great Chain of Being has long been used to rationalize whatever hierarchies those in power wish to rationalize. It has been and is central to the notion of Divine Right of Kings, to racism, to patriarchy, to empire.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Our perception of evolution is infected with this belief in the Great Chain of Being, as often people (including scientists) think, write and act as though all of evolution was about creating more and more perfect creatures, leading eventually to that most perfect creature yet: us.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Defending The Great Chain of Being</h3>
                  <p>Once these beliefs are being questioned, the next line of defense is <strong>religion</strong>: we are superior because God says we are.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">A couple of thousand of years ago some people told themselves and their friends the flattering story that they alone among species were created in God's image (and that their culture was God's culture, and that their sex was God's sex), and that God told them to tell everyone else that God gave them dominion over the earth. <strong>The followers of these stories have pillaged their way across the planet, bringing us to today</strong>.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The next line of defense for different types of supremacism is <strong>science</strong>. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Science is founded on and implicitly fosters human supremacism since it's based on the notion of the intelligent, meaningful, superior, spectating and speculating human subject who observes, measures, and controls a less or unintelligent, meaningless, inferior object or Other: a resources</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Science has from the beginning been about increasing human control over the rest of the world</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">With science, Perfect and Abstract Reason (scientific law, abstract economics) substituted a Perfect and Abstract Distant Sky God </li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Machines now substituted angels, since of course machines are far more perfect than humans, far more controllable and not subject to "human error". 
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Most of scientific (and "common sense") arguments used to defend human supremacism are tautological: <strong>humans choose human characteristics as the measure of what characteristics define superiority</strong>. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Being/Not Being</h3>
                  <p>Human supremacists draw the line of being/not-being between humans and nonhumans, with humans being sentient and having lives worth moral consideration, and nonhuman animals, not so much. Vegans often draw the line of being/not-being between nonhuman animals and plants, with nonhuman animals being (to varying degrees) sentient and having lives worth moral consideration, and plants, not so much.</p>
                  <p><strong>I believe that no matter whom you eat, you are eating someone.</strong></p>
                  <p>There are at least 4 problems with the notion that humans are smarter and superior because of the size of our brains:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">A tautology is "a logical statement in which the conclusion is equivalent to the premise". Humans have big brains. Humans decide big brains are a sign of intelligence and superiority. Therefore, because humans have big brains, humans must be more intelligent and superior</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Is it meaningul or appropiate to make intelligence comparisons across species. Humans are more intelligent at what?</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">It's very possible that we think with more than our brains. We think with our whole bodies, and with our surroundings</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">And if we do think with our brains, we have to recognize that there are plenty of beings with brains larger than ours</li>
                  </ol>
