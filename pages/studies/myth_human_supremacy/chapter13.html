                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>The logic behind the technologies can come to rule. The technics, and not the people or the landbase, are in control. <strong>Actions are taken to protect and further the technics, not living beings</strong>.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Corporations are legal tools to facilitate commerce. When corporations (legal fictions) control social decision making processes, the tools are literally in charge</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Money is a legal tool to facilitate exchange. But when social decisions are made not primarily because they serve humans and nonhumans, but rather because they "make money", then money is obviously controlling the decision-making process</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>When social decisions are made not primarily because they serve life, but because they increase the power of the decision-makers and others of their class, then power itself and not life is the real authority behind the decisions</strong></li>

                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Imagination</h3>
                  <p>One of the (many) ways this culture is killing the planet is through a lack of imagination.</p>
                  <p><strong>Most exploiters can't imagine life without the benefits of their explotation, and can't imagine that anyone else could imagine going through life being any less exploitative than they are</strong>.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>It's insane to favor textile mills, blast furnaces, electric railways and advanced industrial processes over a living planet. Our ability to imagine is so impoverished that we can't even imagine what's happenning right in front of our faces.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>How can it be so difficult to understand that humans can survive (and have survived) quite well without an industrial economy, but and industrial economy (and in fact, any economy) can't survive without a living planet?</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__list-item">Cooperation</h3>
                  <p><strong>Within this supremacist culture our epistemology (how we know whether something is true) is tied to domination</strong>. "Science bases its claims to truth on its spectacular ability to make matter and energy jump through hoops on command, and to predict what will happen and when".</p>
                  <p>This tie between domination and epistemology is generally accepted without question or thought in this culture. Likewise, within this supremacist culture it's <strong>authoritarian technics that are generally considered the greatest achievements</strong>.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><em>Cooperation</em>, in this culture, doesn't mean reading the needs of those in your community and responding to them by helping these others. It doesn't mean cooperating with the living planet to make this living planet healthier, as is normal behavior for residents of this planet</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><em>Cooperation</em> in this case means the creation of "complex human machines composed of specialized, standarized, replaceable, interdependent parts: the work army, the military army and the bureaucracy"</li>
                  </ul>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Gosh, it's a lot more flattering to say that humans are superior because we learned to "cooperate" rather than to say we're superior because we learned the power of top-down, military-style bureaucratic organization, isn't it?</p>
