                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>Few things are more demoralizing than believing you're running your life the wrong way and feeling helpless to change it. If you keep failing at your attempts to be like all the "normal" people around you, you might feel like a misfit, even a failure.</p>
                  <p>This is how many Scanners see themselves. It's painful to watch these remarkable people be hard on themselves for not sticking to one path in life or hear them <strong>use as proof of their failure the very best things about them</strong>: their curiosity and fascination for what's new, their willingness to explore unfamiliar worlds, their exceptional ability to learn new concepts, their enthusiasm for experience.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <div class="card card__actionable-steps">

                      Scanners Toolbox: The "What Have I Done so Far?" List
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-body">
                      <p>Take out a sheet of paper or your Scanner Daybook and write a list with as many experiences or accomplishments (big and small) as you can think of. Include all the projects you started that didn't get finished, businesses that didn't get off the ground, courses you didn't complete and novels you planned but didn't write.</p>
                      <p>Did you surprise yourself? Most people do. </p>
                      <p>If you're like most Scanners, you thought those things didn't count, or even worse, you believed that since you didn't develop every single thing you started, it meant you were a failure.</p>
                    </div>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Why are Scanners the way they are?</h3>
                  <p>Why can't Scanners stick to anything? Why won't they make up their minds? Do they really fear commitment? Do they have some kind of learning disability? Do they have some kind of learning disability? Are they hopelessly immature, shallow, afraid of hard work? If not, why don't they make their lives easier and do something about their problem?</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>Having so many interests is difficult by itself, but being criticized for your inability to settle down and being worried that you'll never accomplish anything creates a load that's just too heavy to carry.</p>
                  </div>
                  <ol>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>Scanners can't have fewer interests</strong>.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>Scanners don't want fewer interests.</strong> 
                      <p>Scanners want it all not because they're spoiled but for the same reason all your muscles want exercise. Scanners love variety because they have brains that process things quickly and are ready for new subjects sooner than other people</p>
                    </li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><strong>Scanners can, so they must, explore many things</strong>.
                      <p>Scanners are smart and mutltitalented. Most Scanners aren't as attached to stability as other people.</p>
                      <p>When you see someone with no tolerance for boredom, who is curious about almost anything new and has the ability to constantly process fresh material, you're looking at a Scanner.</p>
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Durations and Rewards</h3>
                  <p>When it comes to passion, I think we'd all agree that a bee seems very dedicated to its task, but it's not passionate about any one flower: it's passionate about gathering nectar. </p>
                  <p>However, as a culture, we're not in the habit of thinking about Scanners the same way. We simply assume that a Scanner has a problem if they don't stay at one interest as long as we believe they should stay (usually for their whole adult life or at least until the job is "finished").</p>
                  <p>But if we don't know WHY the Scanner is involved with a subject (meaning, what kind of nectar they're after), we really have no way of knowing what their duration is, so <em>we don't know when they're finished</em>. </p>
                  <p>Almost no one has such a low tolerance for boredom as Scanners (for them, boredom is excruciating). Also, by definition, no one has as many different interests as Scanners. This makes their comings and goings very noticeable to the eyes of others. </p>
                  <p>The typical Scanner learns faster than almost anybody. They run through their interests in record time because they have a big, hungry brain and their favorite food is learning. Scanners love learning more than anything else. And learning is what they're most talented at. </p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>The worst thing that can be said about a Scanner is that they don't stick to things as long as other people think they should.</p>
