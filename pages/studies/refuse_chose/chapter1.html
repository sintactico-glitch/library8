                <div class="subsection">
                  <p>Unlike most people who seem to find and be satisfied with one area of interest, Scanners are genetically wired to be interested in many things. And this is exactly what you've been trying to do. </p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>What you've assumed is a disability to be overcome by sheer will is actually an exceptional gift.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Scanners: because instead of diving down into the depths of an interest, we scan the horizon for many interests.</p>
                  <p>"Every single thing she sees or thinks of sparkles with potential and pulls her attention. She wants to do them all. But she's totally stuck and ends up doing none of them".</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>If Scanners didn't think they should limit themselves to one field, 90% of their problems would cease to exist!</p>
                  </div>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">What Is a Scanner?</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Scanners don't love to do one thing <em>or</em> the other, they love them all.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">However, most Scanners believe they're allowed to pursue only one path. But they want them all. If they force themselves to make a choice, they're forever discontented.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Usually, Scanners don't choose anything at all. And they don't feel good about it. </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>As kids, most Scanners had a great time. At school no one objected to their many interests, every school hour was devoted to a different subject. </p>
                  <p>At the end of high school things changed: everyone was expected to make a choice. The conventional wisdom was that "if you're a jack-of-all-trades, you'll always be a master of none, a dabbler, a superficial person, and you'll never have a decent career". </p>
                  <p><strong>Suddenly, a Scanner who all through school might have been seen as an enthusiastic learner has now become a failure. </strong></p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>If the world had just continued to accept them as they were, Scanners wouldn't have had any problems. </p>
                    <p>The only thing Scanners needed was to reject conventional wisdom that said they were doing something wrong and claim their true identity. </p>
                  </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Who is a Scanner?</h3>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Intense curiosity about numerous unrelated subjects is one of the most basic characteristics of a Scanner</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Endlessly inquisitive</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">A Scanner doesn't want to specialize in any of the things they love, because that means giving up all the rest </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Our society frowns on this apparent self-indulgence. Of course, it's not self-indulgence at all: it's the way Scanners are designed, and there's nothing they can or should do about it. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">A Legacy of Generalists</h3>
                  <p>Until the technological race with the Soviet Union after World War II changed our views, the kind of people we call Scanners were admired. </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Universities turned into specialized training centers where science and technology (the realm of specialists) was of highest importance.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">Departments of literature, humanities and history were seen as irrelevant luxuries.</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item">No longer described as "Renaissance people" or "erudite", almost overnight all Scanners were seen as irrelevant, silly and irresponsible.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>Almost everyone in our society takes it as self-evident truth (simple common sense), that Scanners are doing something wrong. Unfortunately, this has come to include Scanners themselves. </p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>It's essential that you never forget that for most of human history, a person with a wide range of knowledge and abilities was highly valued. </p>

                    <div class="card-body">
                      <p>Scanners often avoid getting involved with a new, fascinating subject when it catches their eye. "How can I justify wandering off in yet another direction?". And that's a real shame because they're not breaking the law or hurting anyone by being curious or enthusiastic by some new thought.</p>
                      <p><strong>Each time they push away an interesting new activity, they're reinforcing the myth that they <em>are</em> doing something wrong</strong>.</p>
                      <ul>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">A Scanner Daybook is a blank book devoted to what you do each day, related to being a Scanner. It's not a place for journaling or making lists</li>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">This is your personal version of the Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks</li>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">The pages of the Daybook are where you'll capture ideas that could otherwise get lost. <em>No follow up is required on these ideas unless you want to</em> </li>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">Get a notebook you like but more formal that you're used to, one of those books you're almost afraid to write in</li>
                        <li class="summary__list-item">Your Daybook lets you go into planning that new idea without having to actually produce it</li>
                      </ul>
                      <div class="highlight">
                        <p>Writing in your Scanner Daybook is more important than you realize. The very act of considering your explorations worth keeping track of begins to change everything you ever thought about yourself.</p>
                        <p><strong>Respect for ideas is the same as respect for the idea maker: you.</strong></p>
                        <p>Let's end the notion that ideas have no value unless they turn into a business or have some other practical use.</p>
