                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Expressions and Statements</h3>
                  <p>In Chapter 1, we made values and applied operators to them to get new values. Creating values like this is the main substance of any JavaScript program. But that substance has to be framed in a larger structure to be useful. </p>
                  <p><strong>Expression: a fragment of code that produces a value</strong>. Every value that is written literally (such as 22 or "psychoanalysis") is an expression. An expression between parenthesis is also an expression (like binary or unary operators).</p>
                  <p>Expressions can contain other expressions in a way similar to how subsentences in human language are nested. This allows us to build expressions that describe arbitrarily complex computations.</p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>If an expression corresponds to a sentence fragment, a JavaScript statement corresponds to a full sentence. A program is a list of statements. </p>
                  </div>
                  <p>The simplest kind of statement is an expression with a semicolon after it. For example: </p>
                  <pre><code>
<!--                -->1;
<!--                -->!false;
                  </code></pre>
                  <p><strong>A statement amounts to something only if it affects the world</strong>. It could display something on screen or it could change the internal state of the machine in a way that will affect the statements that come after it. These changes are called <strong>side effects</strong>. </p>
                </div>  

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Bindings</h3>
                  <p>We've seen how to produce new values from old values, but this doesn't change the old values, and the new value has to be immediately used or it will dissipate again. <strong>To catch and hold values, JavaScript provides a thing called binding or variable</strong>. </p>
                  <p><code>let caught = 5 * 5;</code></p>
                  <p>The keyword <code>let</code> indicates that this sentence is going to define a binding. It's followed by the name of the binding and, if we want to immediately give it a value, by an = operator and an expression. </p>
                  <p>After a binding has been defined, its name can be used as an expression. The value of such an expression is the value the binding currently holds. </p>
                  <p><code>console.log(caught); // returns 25</code></p>
                  <p><strong>When a binding points at a value, that doesn't mean it's tied to that value forever</strong>. The = operator can be used at any time on existing bindings to disconnect them from their current value and have them point to a new one. </p>
                  <div class="highlight">
                    <p>You should imagine bindings as tentacles, rather than boxes. They don't <em>contain</em> values, they <em>grasp</em> them, 2 bindings can refer to the same value. </p>
                    <p>When you need to remember something, you grow a tentacle to hold on to it or you reattach one of your existing tentacles to it. </p>
                    <p>When you define a binding without giving it a value, the tentacle has nothing to grasp, so it ends in thin air. If you ask for the value of an empty binding, you'll get the value undefined. </p>
                  </div>
                  <p>The keywords <code>var</code> and <code>const</code> can also be used to create bindings:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><code>var</code> is the way bindings were declared in pre-2015 JavaScript. This is no longer used</li>
                    <li class="summary__list-item"><code>const</code> stands for constant. It defines a constant binding, which points at the same value for as long as it lives
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p><strong>The collection of bindings and their values that exist at a given time is called the environment</strong>. When a program starts up, this environment is not empty. It always contains bindings that are part of the language standard, and most of the time, it also has bindings that provide ways to interact with the surrounding system. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Functions</h3>
                  <p><strong>A function is a piece of program wrapped in a value</strong>. Such values can be applied in order to run the wrapped program.</p>
                  <p>Executing a function is called <em>invoking</em>, <em>calling</em> or <em>applying</em> it. You can call a function by putting parentheses after an expression that produces a function value. Usually you'll directly use the name of the binding that holds the function.</p>
                  <p><strong>Values given to functions are called arguments</strong>. Different functions might need a different number of different types of arguments. </p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Return Values</h3>
                  <p><strong>Showing a dialog box or writing text to the screen is a <em>side effect</em></strong>. A lot of functions are useful because of the side effects they produce. Functions may also produce values, in which case they don't need to have a side effect to be useful.</p> 
                  <p>When a function produces a value, it's said to <strong>return</strong> that value.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Control Flow</h3>
                  <p>When your program contains more than one statement, the statements are executed as if they're a story, from top to bottom. For example:</p>
                  <pre><code>
<!--             -->let theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number:"));
<!--             -->console.log("Your number is the square root of " + theNumber * theNumber);
                  </code></pre>
                  <p>The function <code>Number</code> converts a value to a number. We need that conversion because the result of <code>prompt</code> is a string value, and we want a number. There are similar functions called <code>String</code> and <code>Boolean</code> that convert value to those types.</p>
                </div>
              
                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Conditional Execution (if statement)</h3>
                  <p>Not all programs are straight roads. We may want to create a branching road, where the program takes the proper branch based on the situation at hand. This is called <strong>conditional execution</strong>.</p>
                  <p>Condition execution is created with the <code>if</code> keyword in JavaScript. </p>
                  <pre><code>
<!--             -->let theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number: "));
<!--             -->if(!Number.isNaN(theNumber)) {
<!--                -->   console.log("Your number is the square root of " + theNumber * theNumber);
<!--                      -->}
                  </code></pre>
                  <p>(The <code>Number.isNaN</code> function is a standard JavaScript function that returns <code>true</code> only if the argument it's given is <code>NaN</code>)</p>
                  <p><strong>The <code>if</code> keyword executes or skips a statement depending on the value of a Boolean expression.</strong> The deciding expression is written after the keyword, between parentheses, followed by the statement to execute. </p>
                  <p>The statement after the <code>if</code> is wrapped in braces ({ and }). The braces can be used to group any number of statements into a single statement, called a <em>block</em>.</p>
                  <p>You often won't just have code that executes when a condition is true, but also code that handles the other case. We can use the <code>else</code> keyword, together with <code>if</code>, to create 2 separate, alternative execution paths.</p>
                  <pre><code>
<!--             -->let theNumber = Number(prompt("Pick a number: "));
<!--             -->if(!Number.isNaN(theNumber)) {
<!--                -->   console.log("Your number is the square root of " + theNumber * theNumber);
<!--             -->} else {
<!--                -->   console.log("Hey. Why didn't you give me a number?");
<!--             -->}
                  </code></pre>
                  <p>If you have more than 2 paths to choose from, you can "chain" multiple <code>if/else</code> pairs together.</p>
                  <pre><code>
<!--             -->let num = Number(prompt("Pick a number: "));
<!--             -->if(num < 10){
<!--                -->   console.log("Small");
<!--             -->} else if(num < 100){
<!--                -->   console.log("Medium");
<!--             -->} else {
<!--                -->   console.log("Large");
<!--             -->}
                  </code></pre>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">While and Do Loops</h3>
                  <p>Looping control flow allows us to go back to some point in the program where we were before and repeat it with our current program state. For example, a program that outputs all even numbers from 0 to 12:</p>
                  <pre><code>
<!--             -->let number = 0;
<!--             -->while (number <= 12){
<!--                -->   console.log(number);
<!--                -->   number = number + 2;
<!--             -->}
                  </code></pre>
                  <p>A statement starting with the keyword <code>while</code> creates a loop. The word <code>while</code> is followed by an expression in parentheses and then a statement, much like <code>if</code>. <strong>The loop keeps entering that statement as long as the expression produces a value that gives <code>true</code> when converted to Boolean</strong>.</p>
                  <p>A <code>do</code> loop is a control structure similar to a <code>while</code> loop. It's main difference is that <strong>a <code>do</code> loop always executes its body at least once, and it starts testing the condition only after that first execution</strong>. For example, a program that asks you to enter a name until it gets something that isn't an empty string.</p>
                  <pre><code>
<!--             -->let yourName;
<!--             -->do {
<!--                -->   yourName = prompt("Who are you?");
<!--             -->} while (!yourName);
<!--             -->console.log(yourName);
                  </code></pre>
                  <p><strong>Applying the <code>!</code> operator will convert a value to Boolean type before negating it</strong>, and all strings except "" convert to <code>true</code>.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">For Loops</h3>
                  <p>Let's see the example of the even-number printing loop with <code>for</code> instead of <code>while</code>:</p>
                  <pre><code>
<!--             -->for(let number = 0; number <= 12; number = number + 2){
<!--                -->   console.log(number);
<!--             -->}
                  </code></pre>
                  <ul>
                    <li class="summary__list">The part before the first semicolon initializes the loop, usually by defining a binding</li>
                    <li class="summary__list">The second part checks whether the loop must continue</li>
                    <li class="summary__list">The final part updates the state of the loop after every iteration</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In most cases, this is shorter and clearer than a <code>while</code> loop.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Breaking out of a loop</h3>
                  <p>Having the looping condition produce <code>false</code> is not the only way a loop can finish. There is a statement called <code>break</code> that has the effect of immediately jumping out of the enclosing loop. For example, this program finds the first number that is both greater than or equal to 20 and divisible by 7.</p>
                  <pre><code>
<!--             -->for(let current = 20; ;current = current +1){
<!--                -->   if(current % 7 == 0){
<!--                -->     console.log(current);
<!--                -->     break;
<!--                -->   }
<!--             -->}
<!--             -->// returns 21
                  </code></pre>
                  <p>The <code>continue</code> keyword is similar to <code>break</code>, in that it influences the progress of a loop. When <code>continue</code> is encountered in a loop body, control jumps out of the body and continues with the loop's next iteration.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="subsection">
                  <h3 class="summary__title--subtitle">Switch</h3>
                  <p>If we need to execute different actions according to an specific value, we could use a bunch of nested <code>if</code> statements. Or we could use <code>switch</code>.</p>
                  <pre><code>
<!--             -->switch(prompt("What is the weather like?")){
<!--                -->   case "rainy":
<!--                -->     console.log("Remember to bring an umbrella");
<!--                -->     break;
<!--                -->   case "sunny":
<!--                -->     console.log("Dress lightly");
<!--                -->     break;
<!--                -->   case "cloudy":
<!--                -->     console.log("Go outside");
<!--                -->     break;
<!--                -->   default:
<!--                -->     console.log("Unknown weather type!");
<!--                -->     break;
<!--             -->}
                  </code></pre>
                  <p>You can put any number of <code>case</code> labels inside the block opened by <code>switch</code>. The program will start executing at the label that corresponds to the value that <code>switch</code> was given, or at <code>default</code> if no matching value is found. <strong>It will continue exceuting, even across other labells, until it reaches a <code>break</code> statement</strong>.</p>
